out here busting their humps so we can have such a great time uh and thank\\n0:12\\nyou all for coming uh I thought I had 50 minutes I have 45 I'm going to talk fast\\n0:18\\nand instead of Q&A there's a book seller in the book signing areas bringing in some of my books you don't have to buy a\\n0:23\\nbook just come over and say hello I'm going to sit there until everyone who's got a question uh has had a chance to\\n0:28\\nask it so that's uh opposite the vendor area gates after this talk that's the housekeeping here so I want to start by\\n0:34\\nasking an important question which is what the [ __ ] happened to the old good internet I\\n0:41\\nmean our bosses were a little surveillance happy and yeah they were totally up for sharing their data with\\n0:47\\nthe NSA and if there was ever a toss up between our user security and growth\\n0:53\\nthey always cashed out for YOLO but Google search whatever else we could say\\n0:58\\nabout it it worked and Facebook actually used to give you a feed that shows you\\n1:03\\nthe things that you asked to see Uber used to be cheaper than a taxi and pay\\n1:10\\nthe drivers more than a cab driver Amazon used to actually sell products\\n1:17\\nnot this shine grade self-destructing drop ship garbage from Brands you've never heard of whose names consist\\n1:23\\nentirely of consonant Apple used to defend your\\n1:29\\nprivacy rather other than spying on you with a device you're not allowed to modify to turn off the surveillance\\n1:34\\nthere was a time where if you search for an album on Spotify you'd find the album not a playlist with the same uh image\\n1:42\\nand title as the album but which consists of a bunch of things that someone paid to put in that playlist\\n1:48\\nMicrosoft used to sell you software yeah it was very buggy software but now they\\n1:54\\ndon't even do that they just let you access apps in the cloud and they watch how you use those apps figure out which\\n1:59\\nteachers you value the most pull them out of the basic rate and sell them back to you as an upsell what and I cannot\\n2:06\\nstress this enough what the [ __ ] happened so obviously I am talking about\\n2:12\\ninid ification and from the outside here's what in shid ification looks like first you see a business that's being\\n2:18\\ngood to its end users you know Google puts the best search results at the top Facebook shows you a feet of posts from\\n2:24\\npeople you ask to follow Uber charges small dollars for a cab Amazon subsidizes goods and returns and\\n2:30\\nshipping and puts the best match for your product search at the top of the search results and that's stage one\\n2:36\\nthat's the part where they're good to end users but there's a hidden part of stage one call it like stage 1A and\\n2:42\\nthat's the part where they're figuring out how to lock in those users so if you're Facebook the users just do it for\\n2:49\\nyou you joined Facebook because there were people on Facebook you wanted to hang out with and other people they\\n2:56\\njoined Facebook because they wanted to hang out with you that's those old network of effects in action and with\\n3:01\\nnetwork effects come a collective action problem because you love your friends\\n3:07\\nbut God damn are they a pain in the ass sure you all agree that Facebook sucks but can you agree on when it's time to\\n3:13\\nleave no way can you agree on where to go if you're going to leave hell no\\n3:19\\nyou're you're there because that's where the support group for your rare disease is hanging out and your bestie is there\\n3:25\\nbecause that's where they talk with the people in the country that they moved away from and then there's friend who coordinates their kids little league car\\n3:32\\npools on Facebook and the best dungeon master you know is there and she's not going to leave cuz that's where her\\n3:37\\ncustomers are so you're stuck because even though Facebook use comes at a high cost to you your privacy your dignity\\n3:44\\nyour sanity it's still less than the switching cost you'd have to endure if you went somewhere else all those\\n3:50\\nfriends who have taken you hostage and who you are also holding hostage now\\n3:56\\nsometimes companies lock you in with money Amazon gets you to prepay for a Year's worth of shipping with Prime and\\n4:02\\nthey want to sell you your audible audio books on a monthly subscription which virtually guarantees that every shopping\\n4:08\\nexpedition starts on Amazon because you've already paid for the shipping sometimes they lock you in with digital\\n4:13\\nRights Management like HP who will sell you a printer with four in cartridges with fluid inside it that retails for\\n4:19\\nmore than $10,000 a gallon so and then and using and they use DRM to stop you\\n4:25\\nfrom refilling any of those cartridges use or using a third party cart so when one cartridge runs dry you have to\\n4:32\\nrefill it or you have to throw away the other three cartridges which are full of liquid that cost more than vintage v\\n4:38\\nCleo sometimes the vendor uses a grab bag of locked in techniques like you can't run an IOS app unless you're using\\n4:45\\nApple hardware and you can't run the music the books and the videos you bought from Apple except in an iOS\\n4:54\\napp that's a happy sound uh can you I\\n5:04\\n[Music]\\n5:30\\ncan we get this mic up oh here we are great we have the\\n5:35\\ntechnology sometimes the vendor is doing this gra grab bag stuff like apple does so you need the Apple Hardware to run\\n5:40\\nthe Apple apps you need the Apple apps to play the Apple media and then the phone itself it uses Parts pairing which\\n5:47\\nis DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main computer in the device so you can't use third party part parts to\\n5:53\\nfix it and every part in that device in your uh um uh iPhone has got a\\n5:59\\nmicroscopic Apple logo engraved on it so that if it gets broken up for parts in the Far East and shipped back to the us\\n6:06\\nthey can ask US Customs in Border Patrol to seize it at the border as a trademark violation that's some real thinking\\n6:13\\ndifferent so getting you locked in completes phase one of the inchid ification cycle cycle and Heralds the\\n6:20\\nbeginning of stage two this is when things are made worse for you as an end user in order to make things better for\\n6:26\\nthe business customers that they're making money from so for example platforms might poison their search\\n6:31\\nresults like Google which sells more and more of that results page to ads that are identified with smaller and smaller\\n6:38\\nand grayer and grayer type next to it that says ad or Amazon which sells off\\n6:44\\nits search results calling this an ad business they make $38 billion a year\\n6:49\\nselling search placement for your queries so that the first result when you search Amazon on average is 29% more\\n6:56\\nexpensive than the best result on Amazon the first row is 25% more expensive than\\n7:01\\nthe best result on Amazon and that best result is on average 17 places down on\\n7:07\\nthat search result page right or the vendor they'll poison your feed uh like\\n7:12\\nuh uh like Facebook which started off obviously showing you the things that you asked to see but the Quantum of\\n7:18\\ncontent from the people that you asked to hear from has dwindled and dwindled to a kind of homeopathic residue leaving\\n7:25\\nbehind a void that can be filled up with things that people will pay to show you so a lot of that is ADS but a lot of it\\n7:31\\nis boosted posts from Publishers that you haven't subscribed to those Publishers they have to pay because they\\n7:38\\ncan't reach their own subscribers without paying to boost now um at this point you might be thinking sure if\\n7:44\\nyou're not paying for the product you're the product but that is [ __ ] it is absolute [ __ ] the people who buy\\n7:50\\nGoogle ads they pay more every year for Worse targeting and more odd fraud like\\n7:56\\nthe Publishers who are paying to reach you even though you subscribed to them the Amazon sellers with the best match\\n8:02\\nfor your query have to outbid everyone else just to be in the first page of results and it cost so much to sell on\\n8:09\\nAmazon 41 to 51 45 to 51% of the sale price of everything that you buy on\\n8:16\\nAmazon is being scooped up by Don Bezos and the Amazon crime family those those\\n8:22\\nsellers they do not have the margin to kick up 45% to Amazon so they have to\\n8:29\\nraise prices in order to avoid losing money on every sale but wait I hear you\\n8:34\\nsay but wait I hear you say things on Amazon aren't more\\n8:40\\nexpensive than the things I buy at Target or Walmart or my mom and pop Store direct from the vendor how can\\n8:46\\nthey be raising prices on Amazon if the price on Amazon is the same as the price everywhere else does anyone want to\\n8:51\\nguess how that works they raise the prices everywhere else because Amazon binds their sellers\\n8:59\\nto a policy called most favored nation status which means that the cheapest price they offer has to be matched on\\n9:06\\nAmazon so they sell more they charge more everywhere now these sellers are\\n9:12\\nAmazon's best customers they are paying for the product and they are still getting screwed paying for the product\\n9:18\\ndoes not fill your vapid boss's shriveled heart with so much joy that he decides to stop trying to think of ways\\n9:24\\nto [ __ ] you over look at Apple remember when Apple offered every iOS user a\\n9:31\\noneclick opt out for app based surveillance and 96% of iOS users ticked\\n9:37\\nthat box the other 4% being drunk confused or Facebook employees I mean this cost Apple 10\\n9:46\\nbillion or it cost Facebook $10 billion in the first year alone and we love to see it but did you know that at the same\\n9:52\\ntime Apple turned on iOS spying that gathered exactly the same data on iOS\\n9:59\\nusers for exactly the same purpose for ad targeting for its own ad Network and did not give them any way to opt out and\\n10:06\\nlied about it uh now your iPhone is not an ad supported gimme you paid a th000\\n10:13\\n[ __ ] dollars for that distraction rectangle in your pocket and you are still the product what's more Apple has\\n10:21\\nrigged iOS so that you can't mod the OS to block that spying if you're not\\n10:26\\npaying for the product yeah you're the product but if you are paying for the product you are still the product just\\n10:33\\nask farmers who shell out six figures for Mission critical tractors but can't actually use their tractors when they\\n10:40\\nswap parts into them after they break down until the manufacturer charges them 200 bucks to send a guy to the end of a\\n10:46\\nlonely Country Road and type an unlock code into the console John Deere is not giving away tractors give John Deere\\n10:53\\nhalf million for a tractor and you will be the product please I'm begging you my brothers and sisters and Christ please\\n11:00\\nstop saying if you're not paying for the product you're the product okay so that is phase two of inchid ification phase\\n11:07\\none be good to your users but lock them in phase two screw those users a little so you can be good to business customers\\n11:13\\nwhile locking them in because they need those users then phase three screw everybody and take all the value for\\n11:20\\nyourself leave behind the absolute bare minimum of utility so that everyone stays locked into this pile of [ __ ] and\\n11:27\\n[ __ ] ification a tragedy three acts so that is what inchid ification looks like\\n11:33\\nfrom the outside but what is going on inside the company what is the pathological mechanism what sci-fi\\n11:40\\nentropy Ray are our bosses aiming at these products to make them so bad so quickly well I call that uh mechanism\\n11:48\\ntwiddling twiddling is when someone is altering the back end of a service to change its business operations to change\\n11:55\\nits prices its costs its search ranking its recommend criteria and other\\n12:00\\nfoundational aspects of the system digital platforms are a twiddler's\\n12:06\\nUtopia a grocer would need an army of teenagers with pricing guns on roller\\n12:12\\nblades to reprice everything in the store if someone comes in who looks like they're feeling spendy but McDonald's\\n12:18\\nInvestments has a portfolio company called plexure and they advertise that they can use surveillance data to figure\\n12:24\\nout when a customer has just been paid and add three bucks to the price of the breakfast sandwich\\n12:30\\nand and of course as the prophet William Gibson told us cyberspace is Ting with\\n12:36\\ndigital shelf tags Grocers can twiddle prices in real time like the grocers in Norway where they're adding these e in\\n12:43\\nuh grocery shelf tags and changing prices up to 2,000 times a day now it's\\n12:50\\nnot just grocery stores every Uber driver gets offered a different wage for every job if the driver's been picky\\n12:57\\nlately the job pays more but if the driver's been desperate enough to grab every app that the every uh job that the\\n13:03\\napp is offering the pay goes down and down and down the law professor Vina\\n13:09\\ndubel calls this algorithmic wage discrimination and it's a prime example\\n13:14\\nof twiddling and every YouTuber every Tik tocker they know what it's like to be twiddled you spend weeks or months\\n13:20\\nworking on a video you spend thousands of dollars and then the algorithm decides that no one not even your\\n13:26\\nsubscribers not Searchers who type in the name of the video will actually see that video why who knows the algorithm's\\n13:35\\nrules are not public because content moderation is the only security discipline in which we still say that\\n13:42\\nthere is security through obscurity we can't tell you how the Como algorithm Works otherwise you might figure out how\\n13:47\\nto cheat YouTube in other words is the kind of shitty boss who docks your paycheck every week for violating rules\\n13:54\\nbut won't tell you what those rules are in case you figure out how to break them next week without him docking your\\n14:00\\npaycheck now twiddling also works in some users favor of course sometimes platforms twiddle things to make things\\n14:07\\nbetter for some of their uh end users or business customers so the best example I know about this comes from the for of\\n14:13\\njournalist Emily Baker white who uh broke a story about how Tik Tok has a feature on its back end that its\\n14:19\\nstrategic managers can use called the heating tool when a manager applies the heating tool to performers account that\\n14:26\\nperformers videos are thrust into the feeds of millons ions of users uh without regard to whether or not the\\n14:32\\nrecommendation algorithm would uh uh organically recommend that to those uh to those viewers now why would they do\\n14:38\\nthat here's an analogy from my uh my uh uh Dewey Boyhood growing up in Toronto\\n14:44\\nuh there was a traveling fair that used to come to Toronto every summer called the Canadian national exhibition and if\\n14:49\\nyou've been to a fair like the X you know that uh you always spot some guy on the Midway lugging around a giant teddy\\n14:56\\nbear uh nominally you win those Teddy teddy bears by getting five balls in a peach basket but to a first\\n15:02\\napproximation no one has ever gotten five balls in a peach basket that guy\\n15:07\\nwon his teddy bear because a Carney gestured at him and said fella I like your face I tell you what you're what\\n15:12\\nI'm going to do you got just one ball on that peach basket I'll give you a keychain you got two keychains I'll let\\n15:18\\nyou trade up to the teddy bear that is how that guy got the teddy bear which he is now doomed to drag up and down the\\n15:25\\nMidway all godamn day now why did the Carney give away the teddy bear because it turned that guy into a walking\\n15:31\\nbillboard for the Midway games if that Dopey looking Judas goat can win a giant\\n15:37\\nteddy bear then maybe you can too except you can't Tik tok's heating tool is a\\n15:43\\nway to give away extremely tactical giant teddy bears when someone at the Tik Tock Brain Trust decides they need\\n15:50\\nmore Sports Bros on the platform they pick out one bro at random and they make him King for the day they heat the [ __ ]\\n15:56\\nout of his account that guy gets a zillion views and he starts running around in all the sports bro forums\\n16:02\\ntrumpeting his success I am the Louis pastor of online Sports bro\\n16:07\\ncontent the other sports Bros Pile in and they start retooling to make video\\n16:12\\nthat complies with the idiosyncratic requirements of Tik Tok and when they fail to get giant teddy bears of their\\n16:18\\nown they assume it's because they're doing Tik Tok wrong because they don't know about the heating tool but then\\n16:25\\ncomes the day when the Tik Tok Star Chamber decides that they've got enough sports Bros on the platform so they take\\n16:31\\nthe heat off that one lucky sports bro and maybe they start heating up some lucky astrologer giant teddy bears are\\n16:38\\nall over the place those Uber drivers who the New York Times lavish so much ink on who are making $100,000 a year\\n16:44\\ndriving for Uber or the sub stackers who are rolling in D or Joe Rogan's $100\\n16:49\\nmillion Spotify playout those are all people who are the unwitting recipients\\n16:55\\nof giant teddy bears and those giant teddy bears are a godamn bar because every dollar you spend on a\\n17:01\\ngiant teddy bear turns into five or $10 worth of Free Labor from people who think that they have a shot of earning\\n17:07\\none of their own now platforms can play games with every part of their business logic in highly automated ways that\\n17:14\\nallows them to quickly and efficiently siphon value from end users and give it to business customers from business\\n17:20\\ncustomers back to end users and then back and back again hiding the PE in the Shell game uh at machine speeds until\\n17:27\\nthey've got everyone so turned around that they can take all the value excuse me they can take all the value for\\n17:33\\nthemselves that's the how how the platforms do that trick where they are good to users then they lock those users\\n17:40\\nin then they take something away from those users and give it to business customers and lock them in and then they\\n17:45\\ntake the value for themselves so now we know what is happening we know how it's happening all that's left is why is it\\n17:53\\nhappening now on the one hand there's an answer to this question that's pretty godamn obvious the less value that a\\n17:58\\nbusiness gives to its suppliers its customers its workers the more value there is to left left to divide among\\n18:04\\nthe executives and the shareholders companies uh but but uh that why doesn't\\n18:09\\ntell you why now after all companies could have done this [ __ ] any time over the last 20 years but by and large they\\n18:16\\ndidn't and when they did uh they turned themselves into piles of [ __ ] and they got treated like piles of [ __ ] we\\n18:22\\navoided them and then they died remember Myspace or you um Yahoo search or live\\n18:27\\nJournal I mean yeah you can go to those domains today and find a bunch of AI slop and programmatic ads but those\\n18:33\\nsites are gone and there's the clue it used to be that if you inhu ified your\\n18:39\\nproduct bad things happened to your company now there are no consequences\\n18:44\\nfor inchid ification which is why everyone is doing it right now so I'll break that down there are four forces\\n18:52\\nthat discipline technology companies the first one is obviously competition if your customers find it easy to leave\\n18:59\\nthen you have to worry about them leaving now many factors can contribute to how hard or easy it is to depart a\\n19:05\\nplatform uh uh think of the network effects that Facebook has going for it and the intrinsic cost of going\\n19:10\\nsomewhere else and leaving behind the people that you love there but the most important factor on whether you can\\n19:15\\nleave a platform is whether there's somewhere else to go now remember in 2012 Facebook bought Instagram for a\\n19:23\\nbillion dollar now that might seem like chump change in these days of 11 digigit big Tech Acquisitions but that was a big\\n19:30\\nsum in those innocent days and it was an especially big sum to pay for insta the\\n19:36\\ncompany had 13 employees a mere 25 million registered users but What\\n19:42\\nmattered to Zach wasn't how many users insta had it's where those users came from does anyone know where those insta\\n19:48\\nusers were coming from Facebook they were leaving Facebook and joining insta\\n19:54\\nthey were sick of Facebook even though they like the people there they hated creepy Zu they hated the platform and so\\n20:01\\nthey left and they didn't come back so Zuck spent a billion dollars to recapture them a fact that he put in\\n20:08\\nwriting in a midnight email to his CFO uh David evman explaining that he was\\n20:14\\npaying over the odds because his users hated him and they loved insta so even\\n20:19\\nif they quit Facebook the platform they would still be captured by Facebook the company now on paper that acquisition is\\n20:27\\nillegal normally be hard to prove because you'd have to prove that Zuck bought them for an anti-competitive\\n20:33\\npurpose but in this case Zuck just tripped over his own deck he actually put it in\\n20:39\\nwriting but Obama's doj and Federal Trade Commission they let it slide they\\n20:44\\nwere following the pr Monopoly policies of Reagan Bush one Clinton and Bush two\\n20:51\\nset an example that Trump would follow greenlighting gig emergers like the catastrophic incestuous Warner discover\\n20:58\\nmerger that as of this week restated its value down by $10 billion over one year\\n21:05\\nindeed for 40 years starting with Carter and accelerating through Reagan the US\\n21:10\\nhas encouraged Monopoly formation as an official policy on the grounds that monopolies are efficient if everyone is\\n21:18\\nusing Google search that's something we should celebrate it means they've got the very best search and wouldn't it be\\n21:24\\nperverse to spend public funds to punish them for making the best product but as\\n21:31\\nwe all know Google search did not maintain dominance by being best they did it by paying bribes they spend more\\n21:39\\nthan $20 billion doll a year on Apple to be the default iOS search they spend\\n21:45\\nbillions more to be defaults at Samsung Mozilla and anyone else making a product or a service with a search box ensuring\\n21:52\\nthat you never stumble on a search engine that's any better than theirs even if they are which in turn ensures\\n21:58\\nthat no one will ever invest in a superior search engine even if they are visibly obviously Superior because why\\n22:04\\nbother making something better if Google's buying up all the market oxygen before it can Kindle a product to life\\n22:11\\nFacebook Google Microsoft Amazon they are not making things companies they are buying things companies they take\\n22:17\\nadvantage of official tolerance for anti-competitive Acquisitions predatory\\n22:22\\npricing Market distorting exclusivity deals and other acts specifically\\n22:27\\nprohibited by our antitrust laws they become too big to fail because that\\n22:33\\nmakes them too big to jail and then they become too big to care which is why Google search is a pile of [ __ ] and\\n22:39\\neverything on Amazon is drop Shi garbage that instantly disintegrates into a cloud of off Gast volatile organic\\n22:45\\ncompounds when you open the box once companies no longer fear losing\\n22:51\\nyour business to a competitor it is much easier for them to treat you badly cuz what are you going to do remember when\\n22:57\\nLily Tomlin would be the AT&T operator on those SNL sketches where she do ads for the Bell System and they'd end with\\n23:04\\nwe don't care we don't have to we're the phone company competition is the first force\\n23:10\\nthat serves to discipline companies and the unificatory impulses of their leadership and 40 years ago we stopped\\n23:17\\nenforcing competition law now it takes an an especially smooth brain type of\\n23:23\\n[ __ ] that is an establishment Economist to insist that the collapse of\\n23:28\\nevery single industry from eyeglasses to vitamin C into a cartel of five or fewer companies has nothing to do with the\\n23:35\\npolicies that we embraced that deliberately encourag Monopoly formation it's like we used to put down rat poison\\n23:41\\nand we didn't have a rat problem and then these [ __ ] convinced us to stop putting rats down because R poison\\n23:46\\ndown because rats are good for us we stopped putting the poison down and now rats are eating our faces and they're\\n23:51\\nall running around saying who's to say where all the rats are coming from maybe it's because we sto putting down rat\\n23:57\\npoison but but maybe it's just the time of the rats the great forces of History\\n24:02\\nare bearing down on this moment to multiply rats beyond all measure and nothing we can do uh would stop that\\n24:09\\nantitrust did not slip down a staircase and fall uh back first onto a stiletto\\n24:15\\nthey stabbed it in the back and then they pushed it and when they killed antitrust they killed all hope of\\n24:20\\nRegulation regulation is the second force that disciplines companies regulation is possible but only when the\\n24:28\\nregulator is more powerful than the entities that it regulates when a company is bigger than the government it\\n24:35\\ngets damned hard to credibly threaten them uh uh no matter what crimes they're committing that's what protected IBM for\\n24:43\\nall those years when it had its boot on the throat of the American tech industry do you know that the doj fought an\\n24:49\\nantitrust case against IBM from 1970 to 1982 they called it antitrust Vietnam\\n24:56\\nand that every year for 12 consecutive years IBM spent more on lawyers to fight the US Department of Justice antitrust\\n25:03\\ndivision than all the lawyers the US Department of Justice antitrust division paid to fight all the cases in America\\n25:09\\n12 consecutive years and that paid off because by 19982 the president was\\n25:15\\nRonald Reagan a man whose official policy was that monopolies were efficient and he dropped the case and\\n25:21\\nbig blue wriggled off the hook it's hard to regulate a monopolist it's hard to\\n25:26\\nregulate a cartel when a sector is composed of hundreds of competing companies well they compete they\\n25:34\\ngenuinely fight with one another they are trying to poach each other's customers suppliers and uh key employees\\n25:39\\nthey are at each other's throats it's hard enough to get a couple hundred of exe hundred 100 Executives to agree on\\n25:46\\nanything but when they're legitimately competing with one another really obsessing about how to eat each other's\\n25:51\\nlunches they can't agree on anything the second one of them goes to a regulator with some [ __ ] story about how it's\\n25:59\\nimpossible to build a decent search engine without fine grain surveillance or impossible to have a secure and\\n26:04\\neasyto ous operating system without giving it a a a veto to the vendor about which apps you run or how it's\\n26:11\\nimpossible to administer an ISP unless you slow down connections to servers that haven't paid for premium Carriage\\n26:17\\nthere's going to be some other company saying no that's [ __ ] we managed it here's our logs here's our quarterly\\n26:23\\ncash books and here's our customer testimonials and they prove that these guys are lying\\n26:29\\n100 companies are rabble they are a mob they can't agree on a lobbying position they're too busy eating each other's\\n26:35\\nlunch to figure out how to cater a meeting where they would discuss a common lobbying position but let those\\n26:41\\n100 companies uh merge to Monopoly let them absorb one another in an incestuous\\n26:47\\norgy turn into five giant companies so inbred they get corporate hburg jaws and\\n26:53\\nthey will become a cartel and it's easy for a cartel to agree on what [ __ ]\\n26:58\\nthey're going to tell their regulators and to mobilize some of those excess billions that they've reaped through\\n27:04\\nconsolidation which freed them from wasteful competition so that they can capture their Regulators completely you\\n27:11\\nknow Congress used to pass consumer Federal privacy laws whenever we got a new technology not anymore the last time\\n27:18\\nCongress managed to sit down and pass a federal consumer Privacy Law in this country was\\n27:24\\n1988 the video privacy protection act it bans video store clerks from telling\\n27:29\\nnewspapers which VHS cassettes you took home in other words it regulates three things that no longer\\n27:35\\nexist the threat of having your video rental history out there in the public eye was not the last or the most\\n27:42\\nimportant privacy threat we have faced since 1988 and yet Congress has completely failed to pass a Privacy Law\\n27:50\\ntech companies uh regulatory capture involves a risible and transparent Gambit that is so stupid it's an insult\\n27:57\\nto all those risible transparent gambits working so hard out there in the world every day that Gambit is that they claim\\n28:03\\nthat when they violate your consumer your privacy or your labor rights that it's not a crime because they did it\\n28:09\\nwith an app algorithmic wage discrimination is not wage theft we did it with an app um spying on you from\\n28:16\\n[ __ ] to appetite not a privacy violation we did it with an app an Amazon scam that tricks people into\\n28:23\\npaying 29% more than the best match for their search they did it with an app\\n28:28\\nonce we killed competition once we stopped putting down rat poison we got cartels the rats came and ate our faces\\n28:35\\nand the cartels captured their Regulators the rats bought out the poison Factory and they shut it down so\\n28:41\\ncompanies are not constrained by competition or regulation but you know what this is Tech and Tech is different\\n28:49\\nit is different because it's flexible because our computers are these marvelous things called touring complete\\n28:55\\nUniversal Von nyman machines and that means that any intific alteration to a\\n29:01\\nprogram can be disin ified with another program every time HP jacks up the price\\n29:06\\nof ink they invite a competitor to make a refill kit or a compatible cartridge when Tesla installs code that only lets\\n29:14\\nyou use half the charge in your battery they invite a modder to start selling kits to jailbreak your Tesla so you can\\n29:20\\ncharge your whole battery let me take you through a little example of how this works imagine that instead of being here\\n29:26\\nat Defcon we're at a product design meeting for our company's website and the guy leading the meeting puts his hand up and he says all right folks here\\n29:33\\nit is our kpi is Topline ad Revenue I figured out if we make the ads 20% more\\n29:38\\ninvasive and obnoxious we're going to get 2% more ad Revenue we're all going to get a ski holiday in Switzerland this\\n29:44\\nyear and one guy sticks his hand up and he says I love how you think Elon but\\n29:52\\nhas but has it occurred to you that if we make the ads 20% more obnoxious then\\n29:58\\n40% of our users will go to a search engine and type how do I stop seeing ads I mean what a nightmare because once a\\n30:05\\nuser does that the revenue from that user doesn't rise to the projected 102%\\n30:10\\nit doesn't stay static at 100% it goes to zero it stays there forever and he\\n30:15\\nguesses why it never comes back no one ever went back to the search engine and typed how do I start seeing\\n30:21\\nads again once the user jailbreaks their phone or discovers third party or\\n30:28\\ndevelops a relationship with an independent Tesla mechanic who unlock all the DLC in their car that user is\\n30:34\\ngone forever interoperability that latent proper property bequeathed to us\\n30:40\\ncourtesy of haris touring and Von nyman and their infinitely flexible Universal machines is a is a very serious check on\\n30:48\\ninchid ification the fact that Congress hasn't passed a Privacy Law since 1988\\n30:54\\nin part you can counter that by uh uh with the Maj with the that the majority of web users are now running ad blockers\\n31:01\\nwhich are also privacy blockers but no one's ever installed a Tracker blocker for an app because reverse engineering\\n31:08\\nan app puts you in Jeopardy of criminal and civil prosecution under section 121\\n31:13\\nof the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with penalties of a 5-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a First\\n31:20\\nDefense and violating those terms of service puts you in Jeopardy under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act a 1986 law\\n31:28\\nthat Ronald Reagan was stampeded into passing after watching war games and freaking out\\n31:33\\nseriously helping others violate the terms of service by giving them a mod that makes you a Tor feaser engaged in\\n31:41\\ntorous interference with contract and then there's trademark copyright patent all the nonsense we call IP but which\\n31:48\\nJay Freeman from the city of project calls felony contempt of business model so we're back at that product planning\\n31:54\\nmeeting and now it's time to talk about our app and the guy leading the meeting he says all right we're going to make the ads in the app 20% more obnoxious\\n32:01\\nand everyone turns to the loudmouth who shot it down last time and he says no no that's fine but look why are we stopping\\n32:07\\nat 20% why don't we make the ads 100% more obnoxious and get 10% more Revenue\\n32:13\\nbecause we don't care if the user goes and types how do I stop seeing ads into a search engine because you can't so\\n32:19\\nYOLO just in [ __ ] ay way IP is a euphemism for any law that lets an\\n32:25\\nexecutive reach outside of the walls of their business and exert control over customers critics and competitors and an\\n32:31\\napp is just a web page skinned with the right kind of Ip to make it a felony to put an ad blocker in\\n32:39\\nit thank you interrupt used to stop companies\\n32:45\\nfrom in\\n32:50\\nshtifanov out a feature and wanted to sell it back to us as a monthly subscription someone would make a\\n32:55\\ncompatible plugin that worked for a onetime fee or you know for free to help people flee Myspace Facebook gave them a\\n33:02\\nbot you gave that bot your login and password for Myspace it would log in as you several times a day scrape your\\n33:08\\nwaiting messages put them in your Facebook inbox and autopilot them back out onto Facebook so you didn't have to\\n33:14\\nchoose between the people you loved who are on MySpace and Facebook which had promised that it would never spy on you\\n33:20\\ndo you remember that now thanks to the metastasis of Ip all of that is off the\\n33:25\\ntable today Apple owes it very existence to the eyework suite Pages numbers\\n33:30\\nkeynote which are file compatible with Microsoft Office Word uh Excel and\\n33:36\\nPowerPoint but make an iOS runtime that plays back the files you bought from Apple stores on other platforms and they\\n33:42\\nwill nuke you till you glow Facebook wouldn't have had a hope of breaking myspace's grip on social\\n33:49\\nmedia without that scraper but scrape Facebook today in support of an alternative client and their lawyers\\n33:54\\nwill bomb you until the rubble bounces Google scrap every website in the world to create a search index try and scrape\\n34:01\\nGoogle and your head will be on a pike when they did it that was progress when you do it that is piracy every pirate\\n34:08\\nwants to be an admiral and because this handful of companies has so thoroughly captured their regulator they can wield\\n34:15\\nthe power of the State against you when you try to break their grip on power even as their own flagrant violations of\\n34:22\\nour rights go unpunished because they do them with an app Tech lost it fear of\\n34:28\\ncompetition it neutralized the threat from its regulators and then it put those Regulators in harness to attack\\n34:34\\nnew startups who might do onto them as they did unto everyone who dominated before them but even then there was one\\n34:41\\nforce that still kept our bosses in check and that was us that was Tech workers Tech workers have historically\\n34:49\\nbeen in very short supply and that gave us power and our bosses knew it they to\\n34:54\\nget us to work crazy hours they came up with a trick they appealed to our love of Technology they told us we were\\n35:01\\nHeroes of the digital transformation that we would organize the world's information and make it useful what we\\n35:07\\nwould bring the world closer together they brought in expert set dressers to\\n35:13\\nturn our workplaces into Whimsical campuses with free laundry Gourmet cafeterias massages kombucha and a\\n35:20\\nsurgeon onand who would freeze your eggs so you could work through your fertile years they convinced us that we were\\n35:27\\nbeing pampered rather than being tricked into working like government mules now that trick it has a name fiar the\\n35:34\\nlibrarian she calls it vocational awe but Elon Musk just calls it being\\n35:39\\nextremely hardcore and it and it worked well we did put in some long ass hours\\n35:46\\nbut for our bosses this trick failed badly because if you miss your mother's funeral in order to hit some deadline\\n35:53\\nand then your boss orders you to entify the product you missed the funeral for you are going to experience a profound\\n35:59\\nmoral injury which you are absolutely going to make your boss very aware of\\n36:05\\nbecause what are they going to do fire you they can't hire someone else to do your job and the guy across the street\\n36:10\\nwill pay you just as much so workers we held the line when competition\\n36:16\\nregulation and interoperability failed but Supply caught up with demand last\\n36:21\\nyear they fired 260,000 Tech sector workers first six months of this year was another 100,000 you can't tell your\\n36:28\\nbosses to go [ __ ] themselves because they'll fire your ass and give your job to someone else who will be happy to\\n36:33\\nentify the product you sweated blood to ship that's why all this is happening\\n36:39\\nright now our bosses are not different they did not catch a mind virus that\\n36:44\\nturn them into greedy [ __ ] who don't care about our users's well-being or the quality of our products as far as our\\n36:50\\nbosses are concerned they have uh the point of that business was to charge the most deliver the least and share as\\n36:57\\nlittle as possible with suppliers workers and customers in order to retain money for shareholders and Executives\\n37:04\\nthey are not running Charities since day one our bosses have reported for work every morning grabbed the giant lever\\n37:11\\nbehind their desk labeled in [ __ ] ification and pulled on it as hard as they could but the lever didn't move\\n37:17\\nmuch it was gummed up by competition by regulation by interoperability by the tech Workforce and as those sources of\\n37:24\\nfriction melted away that inchid ification lever started moving pretty freely now that sucks I know but think\\n37:30\\nabout this for a sec our bosses despite being wildly imperfect vessels capable\\n37:36\\nof rationalizing endless greed and cheating nevertheless made a series of actually great products and services not\\n37:44\\nbecause they were better people then but because they were subject to discipline so it follows that if we want to end the\\n37:50\\ninene if we want to dismantle the in shitet if we want to build a new good internet that our bosses can't wreck we\\n37:58\\nneed to make sure that those constraints are durably installed on our new internet wound around its roots and\\n38:03\\nnerves and we have to stand guard over those forces so that they can't be dismantled again a new good internet is\\n38:11\\none that has the positive aspects of the old good internet the ethic of technological self-determination where\\n38:17\\nusers of technology and the hackers the tinkerers the startups and the others who serve as their proxies can\\n38:23\\nreconfigure the technology to make it work so that it does what they needed to do and cannot be used against them but\\n38:29\\nthe new good internet has to fix the defect of the old good internet the part that made it hard for anyone who wasn't\\n38:35\\nus to figure out how to use it and hell yeah we can do that Tech bosses swear that this is impossible you can't have a\\n38:42\\nconversation with a friend without Zuck being present you can't search the web without letting Google scrape you down\\n38:47\\nto your viscera you can't have a phone that works reliable uh reliably without Apple getting a veto over your software\\n38:54\\nthey claim that it's nonsense to even Ponder this proposition it's like making water that's not wet but that is\\n39:00\\n[ __ ] we can have nice things we can build for the people we love and give\\n39:05\\nthem a place worthy of their time and attention to do that we have to install constraints the first constraint\\n39:12\\nremember it's competition we are living through an epocal shift in competition policy after 40 Years of antitrust\\n39:20\\nenforcement in an induced coma a wave of antitrust Vigor has swept through governments all over the world\\n39:26\\nregulators stepping up to ban monopolistic practices to open up wild Gardens to block anti-competitive\\n39:32\\nmergers and even unwind the corrupt mergers that were undertaken on false pretenses now normally this is the part\\n39:39\\nin this speech where I'd listed all the amazing things that have happened over the past four years the enforcement\\n39:45\\nactions that block companies from becoming too big to care and that scared companies away from even trying like\\n39:50\\nwhiz which just kned out of the largest acquisition offer in world history\\n39:56\\nturning down Google's $23 billion buyout and deciding to you know just be a [ __ ] business that makes money by\\n40:03\\nmaking a product that people want that is sold at a competitive price normally I'd be listing out FTC rule makings here\\n40:10\\nor the ban n that ban Nong competes worldwide uh or the new merger guidelines that the FTC and the doj\\n40:16\\ncooked up which among other things make privacy something that has to be considered in mergers I had a whole\\n40:22\\nsection of this stuff in my notes an absolute Victory lap but I deleted it this week does anyone anyone know why I\\n40:27\\ndeleted it this week anyone want to guess all right this week judge Amit\\n40:34\\nmeta ruling for the DC Circuit of these United States of America in the docket\\n40:39\\n20-30 one0 in a case known as United States versus Google LLC found that\\n40:46\\nGoogle is a monopolist and it has acted as a monopolist to maintain its Monopoly\\n40:52\\nand ordered that Google and the doj propose a schedule for a remedy like break the company\\n41:03\\nup so yeah that was pretty [ __ ] epic now this antitrust stuff is esoteric and\\n41:08\\nI'm not going to shame you if you want to keep a little distance on the subject nearly everyone is an antitrust Normie\\n41:13\\nand that's fine but if you're a normie you're probably only catching little bits and pieces of this narrative and\\n41:19\\nlet me tell you the monopolists know that and they are flooding The Zone with [ __ ] the Wall Street Journal has published 100 editorials condemning con\\n41:27\\nthe chair of the Federal Trade Commission for doing nothing and getting nothing done with public funds anyone\\n41:32\\nout there who know who owns The Wall Street Journal no rert Murdoch rert Murdoch do\\n41:40\\nyou really think Rupert Murdoch Pays His editorial board to write 100 op EDS about someone who's not getting anything\\n41:46\\ndone the reality is that in the United States in the UK in the EU in Australia\\n41:52\\nand Canada and China in Japan and South Korea we are seeing more antitrust action over the past 4 years than over\\n41:58\\nthe preceding 40 and remember the competition law is pretty robust the problem is not the law it's the\\n42:04\\nenforcement priorities Reagan put them in mothballs 40 years ago but that is an elegant weapon from a more civilized age\\n42:11\\nand it has found its way into the hands of people who sure know how to use it and they are swinging for the fences so\\n42:18\\nnext up is regulation as the seemingly inescapable power of the tech Giants is revealed as the Sham that we always\\n42:24\\nsuspected it was governments and Regulators are finally going to kill the one weird trick of violating the law but\\n42:29\\nsaying it's okay cuz we did it with an app in the EU they've got the new digital markets app that requires\\n42:35\\ndominant platforms to open up API so that you can move easily between services and that's a very cool rule but\\n42:41\\nwhat's even cooler is how it's going to be enforced previous EU rules they were called regulations which meant that they\\n42:47\\nhad to be turned into law in each EU member State um and for big Tech that meant that all uh enforcement of laws\\n42:54\\nlike the general data privacy protection regulation started in Ireland where they all pretend to be headquartered and they\\n43:00\\npretend to be headquartered in Ireland because Ireland is a tax Haven and so they fly Irish flags of convenience but\\n43:06\\nhere's the thing if every tax Haven has to be a crime Haven because any company\\n43:11\\nthat is foot loose enough to pretend to be Irish this week could pretend to be maltes or or uh luxembourgian or uh\\n43:18\\ncypret next week so to keep those Foot Loose criminal Enterprises happy that they they have to stop enforcing their\\n43:25\\nlaws that's why the gdpr is such a godamn joke in practice because the only way to get these companies held to\\n43:32\\naccount for their gdpr policies is to go after them in Ireland where the Irish data commissioner barely gets out of bed\\n43:38\\nand when they do they usually spend most of the the day in their pajamas eating breakfast cereal in front of the\\n43:44\\ntelevision now all of this is hardly a secret the European commission knows that it's going on so with the dma the\\n43:50\\ncommission starts all of the reg all of the enforcement in the federal courts which have no uh way in which they are\\n43:57\\nbeholden to these big uh tech companies in other words the we vote priv we\\n44:02\\nviolate privacy excuse me we violate Privacy Law uh that work but it's okay\\n44:08\\nbecause we did it with an app that worked for so many years it's now a dead letter and here in the US the uh dam is\\n44:14\\nfinally breaking on getting a federal Privacy Law for us it's been a minute and the thing is there are a lot of\\n44:20\\npeople who are very angry about how poor Privacy Law is in America not because they're worried about privacy but\\n44:26\\nbecause they worried about other stuff maybe Grampy uh was on Facebook and you think that's how he became a q andon or\\n44:32\\nyou think maybe insta made your teen anorexic or you're worried that cops rolled up all the demonstrators at that\\n44:37\\nblack lives matter demonstration using Google location data or you're worried that they did it to the January 6 riers\\n44:43\\nor that you're worried that red State Attorneys General follow teenagers across state lines into abortion clinics\\n44:49\\nor you're worried that black people are being discriminated against in lending and job applications or that someone made AI uh deep fake porn of you a\\n44:57\\nFederal Privacy Law with a private right of action would do something about all of those problems that makes a very big\\n45:02\\nCoalition for Privacy Law which is why we're seeing a procession of imperfect but steadily improving privacy laws\\n45:09\\nworking their way through Congress so I work for the electronic froner Foundation if you sign up for our list\\n45:15\\nat eff.org we're going to send you emails when those laws come up and you can call up your Congress jerk or your\\n45:21\\nSenator and you can talk to them about it you can make an appointment to drop by their offices when they're in their home district and expl to them that\\n45:27\\nyou're not just a registered voter from their districts that you're the kind of tech person who goes to Defcon and then\\n45:32\\nyou can explain the bill to them that stuff makes a difference so how about self-help how are we doing on making\\n45:39\\ninteroperability legal again I'm I'm nearly done two minutes sorry my mic\\n45:45\\nstopped working for a minute uh how how are we doing on making I'm\\n45:52\\nseriously almost done stop clapping so I can finish uh how are we doing on making interoperability Al again when we got\\n45:57\\nthese state right right to repair bills that ban Parts pairing that ban using DRM for parts uh these bills are pushed\\n46:05\\nby a fantastic group of organizations called the repair Coalition at rep.org and they'll email you one one of these\\n46:12\\nbills are going through your state house and you can meet with your state reps and explain to the JV Squad what you just explained to your federal reps and\\n46:18\\nthe prime mover behind rep.org is I fix it and I fix its founder Kyle wans is here at Defcon so when you see him shake\\n46:26\\nhis hand thank for a service but tell him you've signed up for the mailing list as well now on to that last uh\\n46:32\\nWorkforce and my last page I promise uh uh the the thing that used to stop Tech\\n46:37\\nbosses from going bad and that's you the tech Workforce for years your bosses tricked you into thinking you are\\n46:42\\nfounders and waiting temporarily embarrassed entrepreneurs momentarily drawing a salary not workers your power\\n46:49\\ncame from intrinsic virtue not those La not like those lazy slobs in their unions now that was a trick and you got\\n46:55\\nscammed the power you had came from scarcity so when scarcity ended your indust the industry when the industry\\n47:01\\nstarted ringing in six-figure layoffs your power went away the only durable source of power for Tech workers is as\\n47:08\\nworkers in unions think about Amazon think hold I got to finish stop\\n47:15\\nclapping uh think about Amazon warehouse workers have to piss in bottles and have the highest rate of on the job industry\\n47:22\\nuh injuries of any uh comparable company in the industry whereas Amazon coders get to show up for work with facial\\n47:28\\npiercings green Mohawks and black t-shirts that say things their bosses don't understand they can piss whenever\\n47:34\\nthey want to that's not because Jeff Bezos loves Tech workers it's because they're scared you'll quit and they\\n47:40\\nwon't be able to replace you another willing Gibson quote the future is here it's just not evenly distributed you\\n47:45\\nknow who lives in the future Amazon warehouse workers they are living in your future drivers whose eyeballs are\\n47:52\\nmonitored by AI cameras that do phenology on their faces to figure out when went to dock their pay and\\n47:58\\nwarehouse workers whose bodies are ruined in a matter of months as Tech bosses beef up this Reserve Army of un\\n48:05\\nunemployed skilled Tech workers those Tech workers you folks will arrive at the same future as them look I know you\\n48:12\\nspent your careers explaining in words so small your boss could understand them that you refuse to entify your company's\\n48:17\\nproducts and I thank you for your service but if you want to go on fighting for the user you need power\\n48:23\\nthat's better than scarcity you need a union want to learn how check out the tech workers Coalition and Tech\\n48:29\\nsolidarity and get organized and [ __ ] ification is not here because our bosses changed they were always that guy they\\n48:35\\nwere always yanking the lever what changed was the environment everything that kept the inch ification switch from\\n48:41\\nmoving and that is good news because it means that we can have good products with imperfect people a new good\\n48:47\\ninternet is in our grasp an internet with the technological self-determination of the old good\\n48:52\\ninternet and the grease skid Simplicity of Web 2.0 that let Normie friends get in on the fun Tech bosses want you to\\n48:58\\nthink that ux and in shid ification can't be separated and that is self-serving [ __ ] we know it because\\n49:05\\nwe built the old good internet and we've been fighting a rear guard action to preserve it over the past two decades\\n49:10\\nand it's time to stop playing defense and go on the offense to restore competition to restore regulation\\n49:16\\ninteroperability and Tech worker power so that we can create a new good internet that we're going to need to\\n49:21\\nfight fascism the climate emergency and genocide to build a digital nervous system for for the 21st century in which\\n49:28\\nour children will Thrive and prosper thank\\n49:35\\nyou all right I'm going I'm going to the signing\\n49:41\\narea it's it's uh outside the husters room come and say hello\"}],\n",

       "     'text': '# Conformity-Driven Authoritarianism via Manufactured Unanimity\\n\\n**Conformity-driven authoritarianism** represents a systematic exploitation of [[social comparison theory]] and the [[illusion of unanimity]] to engineer mass adoption of [[misanthropic norms]] through coordinated [[information operations]]. This phenomenon occurs when authoritarian actors leverage [[social media amplification]] and [[astroturfing]] to create false consensus around dehumanizing ideologies, triggering [[conformity cascades]] that override individual moral intuitions.\\n\\n## Theoretical Framework\\n\\n### Social Comparison Manipulation Model\\n\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{N} = (V, E, w)$ represent a social network where $V$ is the set of agents, $E$ the edges representing social connections, and $w: E \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^+$ the influence weights. Each agent $i \\\\in V$ maintains:\\n\\n- **Private belief state**: $b_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}$ representing genuine attitudes\\n- **Perceived social norm**: $n_i^{(t)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}$ representing estimated group consensus at time $t$\\n- **Public expression**: $p_i^{(t)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}$ representing stated positions\\n\\nThe **social comparison function** for agent $i$ is:\\n\\n$$SC_i^{(t)} = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in N_i} w_{ij} \\\\cdot \\\\sigma(p_j^{(t-1)} - \\\\tau_i)$$\\n\\nwhere $N_i$ represents $i$\\'s network neighborhood, $\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot)$ is a sigmoid activation, and $\\\\tau_i$ is agent $i$\\'s [[social proof threshold]].\\n\\n### Manufactured Consensus Dynamics\\n\\nDefine the **authenticity ratio** of observed signals:\\n\\n$$\\\\alpha^{(t)} = \\\\frac{|\\\\{i : p_i^{(t)} = h(b_i, SC_i^{(t)})\\\\}|}{|\\\\{i : p_i^{(t)} \\\\text{ observed}\\\\}|}$$\\n\\nwhere $h(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)$ represents genuine belief expression as a function of private beliefs and social context.\\n\\nUnder [[coordinated inauthentic behavior]], malicious actors inject synthetic signals $\\\\{p_{bot}^{(t)}\\\\}$ such that:\\n\\n$$\\\\alpha^{(t)} = \\\\frac{|V_{authentic}|}{|V_{authentic}| + |V_{synthetic}|} < \\\\alpha_{critical}$$\\n\\nWhen $\\\\alpha^{(t)}$ falls below the critical threshold, the [[preference falsification cascade]] begins.\\n\\n## Mathematical Formalization of Norm Adoption\\n\\n### Misanthropic Norm Diffusion\\n\\nLet $m: \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\rightarrow [0,1]$ represent the **misanthropy index** of expressed positions, where higher values indicate greater dehumanization, [[out-group hostility]], or [[zero-sum thinking]]. The adoption dynamic follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{dm_i^{(t)}}{dt} = \\\\lambda_i \\\\left[ \\\\bar{m}_{N_i}^{(t)} - m_i^{(t)} \\\\right] + \\\\eta_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{I}[\\\\text{perceived majority}] - \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta_{moral}^{(t)}$$\\n\\nwhere:\\n- $\\\\lambda_i$ is the conformity coefficient\\n- $\\\\bar{m}_{N_i}^{(t)}$ is the perceived neighborhood misanthropy level\\n- $\\\\eta_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{I}[\\\\text{perceived majority}]$ represents [[bandwagon effects]]\\n- $\\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta_{moral}^{(t)}$ represents moral resistance\\n\\n### Information Operation Optimization\\n\\nAuthoritarian actors solve the optimization problem:\\n\\n$$\\\\max_{\\\\{p_{synthetic}\\\\}} \\\\sum_{i \\\\in V_{target}} m_i^{(T)} \\\\text{ subject to } \\\\alpha^{(t)} \\\\geq \\\\alpha_{detection}$$\\n\\nThis maximizes misanthropic norm adoption while maintaining plausible deniability.\\n\\n## Exploitation Mechanisms\\n\\n### Astroturfing-Amplified Social Proof\\n\\n[[Astroturfing]] operations create synthetic [[social proof]] by deploying coordinated bot networks that exhibit temporal clustering:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{bot posts at } t | \\\\text{trigger event}) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\pi_k \\\\mathcal{N}(t; \\\\mu_k, \\\\sigma_k^2)$$\\n\\nThis generates artificial [[trending phenomena]] that human users interpret as genuine grassroots sentiment.\\n\\n### Echo Chamber Amplification\\n\\nWithin [[echo chambers]], the perceived consensus becomes:\\n\\n$$C_{perceived}^{(k)} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\text{chamber}_k} w_{kj} \\\\cdot p_j}{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\text{chamber}_k} w_{kj}}$$\\n\\nMalicious actors exploit chamber homophily by targeting high-influence nodes with [[confirmation bias]]-aligned content.\\n\\n### Psychological Reactance Exploitation\\n\\nThe model incorporates [[psychological reactance]] by defining a **freedom threat function**:\\n\\n$$\\\\Psi_i^{(t)} = \\\\max\\\\{0, \\\\beta \\\\cdot (\\\\text{perceived pressure})^2 - \\\\text{autonomy threshold}_i\\\\}$$\\n\\nSophisticated operations alternate between pressure and apparent choice to minimize reactance while maximizing compliance.\\n\\n## Temporal Dynamics and Phase Transitions\\n\\n### Critical Mass Phenomena\\n\\nThe system exhibits phase transitions at critical adoption thresholds. Define the **misanthropic saturation** as:\\n\\n$$S^{(t)} = \\\\frac{1}{|V|} \\\\sum_{i \\\\in V} \\\\mathbb{I}[m_i^{(t)} > m_{threshold}]$$\\n\\nThe transition occurs when:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{dS}{dt} \\\\bigg|_{S=S_c} = \\\\infty$$\\n\\nindicating a [[social tipping point]] where norm adoption becomes self-sustaining.\\n\\n### Hysteresis Effects\\n\\nOnce established, misanthropic norms exhibit [[hysteresis]], requiring significantly more effort to reverse than to establish:\\n\\n$$m_{reversal\\\\_threshold} \\\\ll m_{adoption\\\\_threshold}$$\\n\\nThis asymmetry enables [[ratchet effects]] in authoritarian norm diffusion.\\n\\n## Algorithmic Amplification\\n\\n### Engagement-Driven Optimization\\n\\nSocial media algorithms optimizing for engagement inadvertently amplify divisive content. Let $E(p)$ represent the engagement score for post $p$. The algorithmic ranking function:\\n\\n$$R(p_i) = \\\\alpha_1 \\\\log(E(p_i)) + \\\\alpha_2 \\\\cdot \\\\text{recency}(p_i) + \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdot \\\\text{relevance}(p_i, u)$$\\n\\nsystematically privileges high-arousal content, including [[outrage-inducing]] misanthropic messages.\\n\\n### Filter Bubble Reinforcement\\n\\n[[Collaborative filtering]] algorithms create [[filter bubbles]] by optimizing similarity metrics:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{sim}(u_i, u_j) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}_j}{||\\\\mathbf{p}_i|| \\\\cdot ||\\\\mathbf{p}_j||}$$\\n\\nThis concentrates like-minded users and amplifies minority viewpoints within local clusters.\\n\\n## Cognitive Vulnerability Exploitation\\n\\n### Availability Heuristic Manipulation\\n\\nCoordinated content injection exploits the [[availability heuristic]] by ensuring misanthropic examples dominate easily recalled instances:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{recall misanthropic example}) = 1 - e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\text{exposure frequency}}$$\\n\\n### System Justification Subversion\\n\\nThe framework exploits [[system justification theory]] by presenting authoritarian alternatives as stability-restoring:\\n\\n$$J_{system}^{(t)} = f(\\\\text{perceived chaos}, \\\\text{authoritarian solution salience})$$\\n\\nWhen perceived chaos exceeds tolerance thresholds, individuals become receptive to authoritarian \"solutions.\"\\n\\n## Defense Mechanisms\\n\\n### Distributed Consensus Verification\\n\\nImplement [[Byzantine-fault-tolerant]] consensus protocols that require:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{agreement} \\\\Leftarrow |\\\\{i : \\\\text{verify}(claim_i) = \\\\text{true}\\\\}| \\\\geq \\\\frac{2n}{3} + 1$$\\n\\nThis prevents synthetic majorities from establishing false consensus.\\n\\n### Cognitive Inoculation Protocols\\n\\nDeploy [[prebunking]] strategies using [[cognitive inoculation]] theory:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{resistance}^{(t+1)} = \\\\text{resistance}^{(t)} + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\text{weakened\\\\_exposure} - \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\text{decay}$$\\n\\n### Transparency-Preserving Detection\\n\\nUtilize [[differential privacy]] methods to detect coordination while preserving user privacy:\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{f}(D) = f(D) + \\\\text{Lap}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\right)$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\Delta f$ is the sensitivity of coordination detection function $f$.\\n\\n## Countermeasures and Resilience\\n\\n### Network Structural Interventions\\n\\nImplement [[random graph rewiring]] to break [[homophily-driven]] clustering:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{rewire edge } (i,j)) = \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\text{similarity}(i,j)^{-1}$$\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity Metrics\\n\\nMonitor network-level epistemic health via:\\n\\n$$H_{epistemic} = -\\\\sum_{belief} P(belief) \\\\log P(belief) + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\text{cross-cutting ties}$$\\n\\n## Related Concepts\\n\\n- [[Social Comparison Theory]]\\n- [[Information Cascades]]\\n- [[Astroturfing]]\\n- [[Echo Chambers]]\\n- [[Preference Falsification]]\\n- [[Psychological Reactance]]\\n- [[System Justification Theory]]\\n- [[Cognitive Inoculation]]\\n- [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance]]\\n- [[Filter Bubbles]]\\n- [[Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior]]',\n",

Although the recently developed\\\\nneural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown compelling results in implicit\\\\nrepresentations, the large-scale 3D scene reconstruction using partially lost\\\\nLiDAR point cloud data still needs to be explored. To bridge this gap, we\\\\npropose a novel 3D scene reconstruction framework called parent-child neural\\\\nradiance field (PC-NeRF). The framework comprises two modules, the parent NeRF\\\\nand the child NeRF, to simultaneously optimize scene-level, segment-level, and\\\\npoint-level scene representations. Sensor data can be utilized more efficiently\\\\nby leveraging the segment-level representation capabilities of child NeRFs, and\\\\nan approximate volumetric representation of the scene can be quickly obtained\\\\neven with limited observations. With extensive experiments, our proposed\\\\nPC-NeRF is proven to achieve high-precision 3D reconstruction in large-scale\\\\nscenes. Moreover, PC-NeRF can effectively tackle situations where partial\\\\nsensor data is lost and has high deployment efficiency with limited training\\\\ntime.

Enhanced ArXiv Badge with category information\\n2. Expanded Repository View with detailed arXiv paper information\\n3. Advanced Search capabilities for arXiv-related fields\\n4. New sorting options for arXiv published and updated dates\\n5. Filter by arXiv Category feature\\n6. Updated filtering and sorting logic to include arXiv metadata\\n7. Fetching and integrating arXiv metadata\\n\\nThe component now provides a more comprehensive view of the repositories, especially those associated with arXiv papers. Users can search, filter, and sort based on both GitHub and arXiv-related information, making the dashboard more powerful and informative.\\n\\nTo use this updated Dashboard component, you\\'ll need to ensure that:\\n\\n1. The `github_stars.json` and `arxiv_metadata.json` files are available in your `public` folder.\\n2. All necessary dependencies (React, lucide-react) are installed.\\n3. Your project is set up with Tailwind CSS for styling.\\n\\nThis component should now provide a rich, interactive experience for exploring GitHub repositories with associated arXiv papers. Users can easily find, filter, and sort repositories based on various criteria, including arXiv-specific information.', 'citations': []}], 'sender': 'assistant', 'created_at': '2024-10-15T04:29:32.386791Z', 'updated_at': '2024-10-15T04:29:32.386791Z', 'attachments': [], 'files': []}, {'uuid': 'ed0c4132-ce4e-4d3c-be75-9c3d54ccf1ab', 'text': '999react-dom.production.min.js:188 Error: Minified React error #31;

Here\\'s a summary of the main changes:\\n\\n1. In `getArxivFieldValue`, we now map the `categories` array to extract just the `@term` values.\\n2. In `ArXivBadge`, we now access the category using `paperMetadata.categories[0][\\'@term\\']`.\\n3. In the filtering logic, we\\'ve updated the `includes` and `excludes` cases to handle the new structure of the `categories` array.\\n4. In `ExpandedRepoView`, we now map the `categories` array to display only the `@term` values.\\n\\nThese changes should resolve the React error you were seeing. The error was occurring because React was trying to render an object (the category object with `@term` and `@scheme` properties) directly, which is not allowed.\\n\\nRegarding the 404 error for `manifest.json`, this is not related to your React component. It\\'s a separate issue with your project setup. If you\\'re not using a web app manifest, you can safely ignore this error or remove the reference to `manifest.json` from your `index.html` file.\\n\\nAfter making these changes, your dashboard should work correctly with the provided data structure.
