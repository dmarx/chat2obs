out here busting their humps so we can have such a great time uh and thank\\n0:12\\nyou all for coming uh I thought I had 50 minutes I have 45 I'm going to talk fast\\n0:18\\nand instead of Q&A there's a book seller in the book signing areas bringing in some of my books you don't have to buy a\\n0:23\\nbook just come over and say hello I'm going to sit there until everyone who's got a question uh has had a chance to\\n0:28\\nask it so that's uh opposite the vendor area gates after this talk that's the housekeeping here so I want to start by\\n0:34\\nasking an important question which is what the [ __ ] happened to the old good internet I\\n0:41\\nmean our bosses were a little surveillance happy and yeah they were totally up for sharing their data with\\n0:47\\nthe NSA and if there was ever a toss up between our user security and growth\\n0:53\\nthey always cashed out for YOLO but Google search whatever else we could say\\n0:58\\nabout it it worked and Facebook actually used to give you a feed that shows you\\n1:03\\nthe things that you asked to see Uber used to be cheaper than a taxi and pay\\n1:10\\nthe drivers more than a cab driver Amazon used to actually sell products\\n1:17\\nnot this shine grade self-destructing drop ship garbage from Brands you've never heard of whose names consist\\n1:23\\nentirely of consonant Apple used to defend your\\n1:29\\nprivacy rather other than spying on you with a device you're not allowed to modify to turn off the surveillance\\n1:34\\nthere was a time where if you search for an album on Spotify you'd find the album not a playlist with the same uh image\\n1:42\\nand title as the album but which consists of a bunch of things that someone paid to put in that playlist\\n1:48\\nMicrosoft used to sell you software yeah it was very buggy software but now they\\n1:54\\ndon't even do that they just let you access apps in the cloud and they watch how you use those apps figure out which\\n1:59\\nteachers you value the most pull them out of the basic rate and sell them back to you as an upsell what and I cannot\\n2:06\\nstress this enough what the [ __ ] happened so obviously I am talking about\\n2:12\\ninid ification and from the outside here's what in shid ification looks like first you see a business that's being\\n2:18\\ngood to its end users you know Google puts the best search results at the top Facebook shows you a feet of posts from\\n2:24\\npeople you ask to follow Uber charges small dollars for a cab Amazon subsidizes goods and returns and\\n2:30\\nshipping and puts the best match for your product search at the top of the search results and that's stage one\\n2:36\\nthat's the part where they're good to end users but there's a hidden part of stage one call it like stage 1A and\\n2:42\\nthat's the part where they're figuring out how to lock in those users so if you're Facebook the users just do it for\\n2:49\\nyou you joined Facebook because there were people on Facebook you wanted to hang out with and other people they\\n2:56\\njoined Facebook because they wanted to hang out with you that's those old network of effects in action and with\\n3:01\\nnetwork effects come a collective action problem because you love your friends\\n3:07\\nbut God damn are they a pain in the ass sure you all agree that Facebook sucks but can you agree on when it's time to\\n3:13\\nleave no way can you agree on where to go if you're going to leave hell no\\n3:19\\nyou're you're there because that's where the support group for your rare disease is hanging out and your bestie is there\\n3:25\\nbecause that's where they talk with the people in the country that they moved away from and then there's friend who coordinates their kids little league car\\n3:32\\npools on Facebook and the best dungeon master you know is there and she's not going to leave cuz that's where her\\n3:37\\ncustomers are so you're stuck because even though Facebook use comes at a high cost to you your privacy your dignity\\n3:44\\nyour sanity it's still less than the switching cost you'd have to endure if you went somewhere else all those\\n3:50\\nfriends who have taken you hostage and who you are also holding hostage now\\n3:56\\nsometimes companies lock you in with money Amazon gets you to prepay for a Year's worth of shipping with Prime and\\n4:02\\nthey want to sell you your audible audio books on a monthly subscription which virtually guarantees that every shopping\\n4:08\\nexpedition starts on Amazon because you've already paid for the shipping sometimes they lock you in with digital\\n4:13\\nRights Management like HP who will sell you a printer with four in cartridges with fluid inside it that retails for\\n4:19\\nmore than $10,000 a gallon so and then and using and they use DRM to stop you\\n4:25\\nfrom refilling any of those cartridges use or using a third party cart so when one cartridge runs dry you have to\\n4:32\\nrefill it or you have to throw away the other three cartridges which are full of liquid that cost more than vintage v\\n4:38\\nCleo sometimes the vendor uses a grab bag of locked in techniques like you can't run an IOS app unless you're using\\n4:45\\nApple hardware and you can't run the music the books and the videos you bought from Apple except in an iOS\\n4:54\\napp that's a happy sound uh can you I\\n5:04\\n[Music]\\n5:30\\ncan we get this mic up oh here we are great we have the\\n5:35\\ntechnology sometimes the vendor is doing this gra grab bag stuff like apple does so you need the Apple Hardware to run\\n5:40\\nthe Apple apps you need the Apple apps to play the Apple media and then the phone itself it uses Parts pairing which\\n5:47\\nis DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main computer in the device so you can't use third party part parts to\\n5:53\\nfix it and every part in that device in your uh um uh iPhone has got a\\n5:59\\nmicroscopic Apple logo engraved on it so that if it gets broken up for parts in the Far East and shipped back to the us\\n6:06\\nthey can ask US Customs in Border Patrol to seize it at the border as a trademark violation that's some real thinking\\n6:13\\ndifferent so getting you locked in completes phase one of the inchid ification cycle cycle and Heralds the\\n6:20\\nbeginning of stage two this is when things are made worse for you as an end user in order to make things better for\\n6:26\\nthe business customers that they're making money from so for example platforms might poison their search\\n6:31\\nresults like Google which sells more and more of that results page to ads that are identified with smaller and smaller\\n6:38\\nand grayer and grayer type next to it that says ad or Amazon which sells off\\n6:44\\nits search results calling this an ad business they make $38 billion a year\\n6:49\\nselling search placement for your queries so that the first result when you search Amazon on average is 29% more\\n6:56\\nexpensive than the best result on Amazon the first row is 25% more expensive than\\n7:01\\nthe best result on Amazon and that best result is on average 17 places down on\\n7:07\\nthat search result page right or the vendor they'll poison your feed uh like\\n7:12\\nuh uh like Facebook which started off obviously showing you the things that you asked to see but the Quantum of\\n7:18\\ncontent from the people that you asked to hear from has dwindled and dwindled to a kind of homeopathic residue leaving\\n7:25\\nbehind a void that can be filled up with things that people will pay to show you so a lot of that is ADS but a lot of it\\n7:31\\nis boosted posts from Publishers that you haven't subscribed to those Publishers they have to pay because they\\n7:38\\ncan't reach their own subscribers without paying to boost now um at this point you might be thinking sure if\\n7:44\\nyou're not paying for the product you're the product but that is [ __ ] it is absolute [ __ ] the people who buy\\n7:50\\nGoogle ads they pay more every year for Worse targeting and more odd fraud like\\n7:56\\nthe Publishers who are paying to reach you even though you subscribed to them the Amazon sellers with the best match\\n8:02\\nfor your query have to outbid everyone else just to be in the first page of results and it cost so much to sell on\\n8:09\\nAmazon 41 to 51 45 to 51% of the sale price of everything that you buy on\\n8:16\\nAmazon is being scooped up by Don Bezos and the Amazon crime family those those\\n8:22\\nsellers they do not have the margin to kick up 45% to Amazon so they have to\\n8:29\\nraise prices in order to avoid losing money on every sale but wait I hear you\\n8:34\\nsay but wait I hear you say things on Amazon aren't more\\n8:40\\nexpensive than the things I buy at Target or Walmart or my mom and pop Store direct from the vendor how can\\n8:46\\nthey be raising prices on Amazon if the price on Amazon is the same as the price everywhere else does anyone want to\\n8:51\\nguess how that works they raise the prices everywhere else because Amazon binds their sellers\\n8:59\\nto a policy called most favored nation status which means that the cheapest price they offer has to be matched on\\n9:06\\nAmazon so they sell more they charge more everywhere now these sellers are\\n9:12\\nAmazon's best customers they are paying for the product and they are still getting screwed paying for the product\\n9:18\\ndoes not fill your vapid boss's shriveled heart with so much joy that he decides to stop trying to think of ways\\n9:24\\nto [ __ ] you over look at Apple remember when Apple offered every iOS user a\\n9:31\\noneclick opt out for app based surveillance and 96% of iOS users ticked\\n9:37\\nthat box the other 4% being drunk confused or Facebook employees I mean this cost Apple 10\\n9:46\\nbillion or it cost Facebook $10 billion in the first year alone and we love to see it but did you know that at the same\\n9:52\\ntime Apple turned on iOS spying that gathered exactly the same data on iOS\\n9:59\\nusers for exactly the same purpose for ad targeting for its own ad Network and did not give them any way to opt out and\\n10:06\\nlied about it uh now your iPhone is not an ad supported gimme you paid a th000\\n10:13\\n[ __ ] dollars for that distraction rectangle in your pocket and you are still the product what's more Apple has\\n10:21\\nrigged iOS so that you can't mod the OS to block that spying if you're not\\n10:26\\npaying for the product yeah you're the product but if you are paying for the product you are still the product just\\n10:33\\nask farmers who shell out six figures for Mission critical tractors but can't actually use their tractors when they\\n10:40\\nswap parts into them after they break down until the manufacturer charges them 200 bucks to send a guy to the end of a\\n10:46\\nlonely Country Road and type an unlock code into the console John Deere is not giving away tractors give John Deere\\n10:53\\nhalf million for a tractor and you will be the product please I'm begging you my brothers and sisters and Christ please\\n11:00\\nstop saying if you're not paying for the product you're the product okay so that is phase two of inchid ification phase\\n11:07\\none be good to your users but lock them in phase two screw those users a little so you can be good to business customers\\n11:13\\nwhile locking them in because they need those users then phase three screw everybody and take all the value for\\n11:20\\nyourself leave behind the absolute bare minimum of utility so that everyone stays locked into this pile of [ __ ] and\\n11:27\\n[ __ ] ification a tragedy three acts so that is what inchid ification looks like\\n11:33\\nfrom the outside but what is going on inside the company what is the pathological mechanism what sci-fi\\n11:40\\nentropy Ray are our bosses aiming at these products to make them so bad so quickly well I call that uh mechanism\\n11:48\\ntwiddling twiddling is when someone is altering the back end of a service to change its business operations to change\\n11:55\\nits prices its costs its search ranking its recommend criteria and other\\n12:00\\nfoundational aspects of the system digital platforms are a twiddler's\\n12:06\\nUtopia a grocer would need an army of teenagers with pricing guns on roller\\n12:12\\nblades to reprice everything in the store if someone comes in who looks like they're feeling spendy but McDonald's\\n12:18\\nInvestments has a portfolio company called plexure and they advertise that they can use surveillance data to figure\\n12:24\\nout when a customer has just been paid and add three bucks to the price of the breakfast sandwich\\n12:30\\nand and of course as the prophet William Gibson told us cyberspace is Ting with\\n12:36\\ndigital shelf tags Grocers can twiddle prices in real time like the grocers in Norway where they're adding these e in\\n12:43\\nuh grocery shelf tags and changing prices up to 2,000 times a day now it's\\n12:50\\nnot just grocery stores every Uber driver gets offered a different wage for every job if the driver's been picky\\n12:57\\nlately the job pays more but if the driver's been desperate enough to grab every app that the every uh job that the\\n13:03\\napp is offering the pay goes down and down and down the law professor Vina\\n13:09\\ndubel calls this algorithmic wage discrimination and it's a prime example\\n13:14\\nof twiddling and every YouTuber every Tik tocker they know what it's like to be twiddled you spend weeks or months\\n13:20\\nworking on a video you spend thousands of dollars and then the algorithm decides that no one not even your\\n13:26\\nsubscribers not Searchers who type in the name of the video will actually see that video why who knows the algorithm's\\n13:35\\nrules are not public because content moderation is the only security discipline in which we still say that\\n13:42\\nthere is security through obscurity we can't tell you how the Como algorithm Works otherwise you might figure out how\\n13:47\\nto cheat YouTube in other words is the kind of shitty boss who docks your paycheck every week for violating rules\\n13:54\\nbut won't tell you what those rules are in case you figure out how to break them next week without him docking your\\n14:00\\npaycheck now twiddling also works in some users favor of course sometimes platforms twiddle things to make things\\n14:07\\nbetter for some of their uh end users or business customers so the best example I know about this comes from the for of\\n14:13\\njournalist Emily Baker white who uh broke a story about how Tik Tok has a feature on its back end that its\\n14:19\\nstrategic managers can use called the heating tool when a manager applies the heating tool to performers account that\\n14:26\\nperformers videos are thrust into the feeds of millons ions of users uh without regard to whether or not the\\n14:32\\nrecommendation algorithm would uh uh organically recommend that to those uh to those viewers now why would they do\\n14:38\\nthat here's an analogy from my uh my uh uh Dewey Boyhood growing up in Toronto\\n14:44\\nuh there was a traveling fair that used to come to Toronto every summer called the Canadian national exhibition and if\\n14:49\\nyou've been to a fair like the X you know that uh you always spot some guy on the Midway lugging around a giant teddy\\n14:56\\nbear uh nominally you win those Teddy teddy bears by getting five balls in a peach basket but to a first\\n15:02\\napproximation no one has ever gotten five balls in a peach basket that guy\\n15:07\\nwon his teddy bear because a Carney gestured at him and said fella I like your face I tell you what you're what\\n15:12\\nI'm going to do you got just one ball on that peach basket I'll give you a keychain you got two keychains I'll let\\n15:18\\nyou trade up to the teddy bear that is how that guy got the teddy bear which he is now doomed to drag up and down the\\n15:25\\nMidway all godamn day now why did the Carney give away the teddy bear because it turned that guy into a walking\\n15:31\\nbillboard for the Midway games if that Dopey looking Judas goat can win a giant\\n15:37\\nteddy bear then maybe you can too except you can't Tik tok's heating tool is a\\n15:43\\nway to give away extremely tactical giant teddy bears when someone at the Tik Tock Brain Trust decides they need\\n15:50\\nmore Sports Bros on the platform they pick out one bro at random and they make him King for the day they heat the [ __ ]\\n15:56\\nout of his account that guy gets a zillion views and he starts running around in all the sports bro forums\\n16:02\\ntrumpeting his success I am the Louis pastor of online Sports bro\\n16:07\\ncontent the other sports Bros Pile in and they start retooling to make video\\n16:12\\nthat complies with the idiosyncratic requirements of Tik Tok and when they fail to get giant teddy bears of their\\n16:18\\nown they assume it's because they're doing Tik Tok wrong because they don't know about the heating tool but then\\n16:25\\ncomes the day when the Tik Tok Star Chamber decides that they've got enough sports Bros on the platform so they take\\n16:31\\nthe heat off that one lucky sports bro and maybe they start heating up some lucky astrologer giant teddy bears are\\n16:38\\nall over the place those Uber drivers who the New York Times lavish so much ink on who are making $100,000 a year\\n16:44\\ndriving for Uber or the sub stackers who are rolling in D or Joe Rogan's $100\\n16:49\\nmillion Spotify playout those are all people who are the unwitting recipients\\n16:55\\nof giant teddy bears and those giant teddy bears are a godamn bar because every dollar you spend on a\\n17:01\\ngiant teddy bear turns into five or $10 worth of Free Labor from people who think that they have a shot of earning\\n17:07\\none of their own now platforms can play games with every part of their business logic in highly automated ways that\\n17:14\\nallows them to quickly and efficiently siphon value from end users and give it to business customers from business\\n17:20\\ncustomers back to end users and then back and back again hiding the PE in the Shell game uh at machine speeds until\\n17:27\\nthey've got everyone so turned around that they can take all the value excuse me they can take all the value for\\n17:33\\nthemselves that's the how how the platforms do that trick where they are good to users then they lock those users\\n17:40\\nin then they take something away from those users and give it to business customers and lock them in and then they\\n17:45\\ntake the value for themselves so now we know what is happening we know how it's happening all that's left is why is it\\n17:53\\nhappening now on the one hand there's an answer to this question that's pretty godamn obvious the less value that a\\n17:58\\nbusiness gives to its suppliers its customers its workers the more value there is to left left to divide among\\n18:04\\nthe executives and the shareholders companies uh but but uh that why doesn't\\n18:09\\ntell you why now after all companies could have done this [ __ ] any time over the last 20 years but by and large they\\n18:16\\ndidn't and when they did uh they turned themselves into piles of [ __ ] and they got treated like piles of [ __ ] we\\n18:22\\navoided them and then they died remember Myspace or you um Yahoo search or live\\n18:27\\nJournal I mean yeah you can go to those domains today and find a bunch of AI slop and programmatic ads but those\\n18:33\\nsites are gone and there's the clue it used to be that if you inhu ified your\\n18:39\\nproduct bad things happened to your company now there are no consequences\\n18:44\\nfor inchid ification which is why everyone is doing it right now so I'll break that down there are four forces\\n18:52\\nthat discipline technology companies the first one is obviously competition if your customers find it easy to leave\\n18:59\\nthen you have to worry about them leaving now many factors can contribute to how hard or easy it is to depart a\\n19:05\\nplatform uh uh think of the network effects that Facebook has going for it and the intrinsic cost of going\\n19:10\\nsomewhere else and leaving behind the people that you love there but the most important factor on whether you can\\n19:15\\nleave a platform is whether there's somewhere else to go now remember in 2012 Facebook bought Instagram for a\\n19:23\\nbillion dollar now that might seem like chump change in these days of 11 digigit big Tech Acquisitions but that was a big\\n19:30\\nsum in those innocent days and it was an especially big sum to pay for insta the\\n19:36\\ncompany had 13 employees a mere 25 million registered users but What\\n19:42\\nmattered to Zach wasn't how many users insta had it's where those users came from does anyone know where those insta\\n19:48\\nusers were coming from Facebook they were leaving Facebook and joining insta\\n19:54\\nthey were sick of Facebook even though they like the people there they hated creepy Zu they hated the platform and so\\n20:01\\nthey left and they didn't come back so Zuck spent a billion dollars to recapture them a fact that he put in\\n20:08\\nwriting in a midnight email to his CFO uh David evman explaining that he was\\n20:14\\npaying over the odds because his users hated him and they loved insta so even\\n20:19\\nif they quit Facebook the platform they would still be captured by Facebook the company now on paper that acquisition is\\n20:27\\nillegal normally be hard to prove because you'd have to prove that Zuck bought them for an anti-competitive\\n20:33\\npurpose but in this case Zuck just tripped over his own deck he actually put it in\\n20:39\\nwriting but Obama's doj and Federal Trade Commission they let it slide they\\n20:44\\nwere following the pr Monopoly policies of Reagan Bush one Clinton and Bush two\\n20:51\\nset an example that Trump would follow greenlighting gig emergers like the catastrophic incestuous Warner discover\\n20:58\\nmerger that as of this week restated its value down by $10 billion over one year\\n21:05\\nindeed for 40 years starting with Carter and accelerating through Reagan the US\\n21:10\\nhas encouraged Monopoly formation as an official policy on the grounds that monopolies are efficient if everyone is\\n21:18\\nusing Google search that's something we should celebrate it means they've got the very best search and wouldn't it be\\n21:24\\nperverse to spend public funds to punish them for making the best product but as\\n21:31\\nwe all know Google search did not maintain dominance by being best they did it by paying bribes they spend more\\n21:39\\nthan $20 billion doll a year on Apple to be the default iOS search they spend\\n21:45\\nbillions more to be defaults at Samsung Mozilla and anyone else making a product or a service with a search box ensuring\\n21:52\\nthat you never stumble on a search engine that's any better than theirs even if they are which in turn ensures\\n21:58\\nthat no one will ever invest in a superior search engine even if they are visibly obviously Superior because why\\n22:04\\nbother making something better if Google's buying up all the market oxygen before it can Kindle a product to life\\n22:11\\nFacebook Google Microsoft Amazon they are not making things companies they are buying things companies they take\\n22:17\\nadvantage of official tolerance for anti-competitive Acquisitions predatory\\n22:22\\npricing Market distorting exclusivity deals and other acts specifically\\n22:27\\nprohibited by our antitrust laws they become too big to fail because that\\n22:33\\nmakes them too big to jail and then they become too big to care which is why Google search is a pile of [ __ ] and\\n22:39\\neverything on Amazon is drop Shi garbage that instantly disintegrates into a cloud of off Gast volatile organic\\n22:45\\ncompounds when you open the box once companies no longer fear losing\\n22:51\\nyour business to a competitor it is much easier for them to treat you badly cuz what are you going to do remember when\\n22:57\\nLily Tomlin would be the AT&T operator on those SNL sketches where she do ads for the Bell System and they'd end with\\n23:04\\nwe don't care we don't have to we're the phone company competition is the first force\\n23:10\\nthat serves to discipline companies and the unificatory impulses of their leadership and 40 years ago we stopped\\n23:17\\nenforcing competition law now it takes an an especially smooth brain type of\\n23:23\\n[ __ ] that is an establishment Economist to insist that the collapse of\\n23:28\\nevery single industry from eyeglasses to vitamin C into a cartel of five or fewer companies has nothing to do with the\\n23:35\\npolicies that we embraced that deliberately encourag Monopoly formation it's like we used to put down rat poison\\n23:41\\nand we didn't have a rat problem and then these [ __ ] convinced us to stop putting rats down because R poison\\n23:46\\ndown because rats are good for us we stopped putting the poison down and now rats are eating our faces and they're\\n23:51\\nall running around saying who's to say where all the rats are coming from maybe it's because we sto putting down rat\\n23:57\\npoison but but maybe it's just the time of the rats the great forces of History\\n24:02\\nare bearing down on this moment to multiply rats beyond all measure and nothing we can do uh would stop that\\n24:09\\nantitrust did not slip down a staircase and fall uh back first onto a stiletto\\n24:15\\nthey stabbed it in the back and then they pushed it and when they killed antitrust they killed all hope of\\n24:20\\nRegulation regulation is the second force that disciplines companies regulation is possible but only when the\\n24:28\\nregulator is more powerful than the entities that it regulates when a company is bigger than the government it\\n24:35\\ngets damned hard to credibly threaten them uh uh no matter what crimes they're committing that's what protected IBM for\\n24:43\\nall those years when it had its boot on the throat of the American tech industry do you know that the doj fought an\\n24:49\\nantitrust case against IBM from 1970 to 1982 they called it antitrust Vietnam\\n24:56\\nand that every year for 12 consecutive years IBM spent more on lawyers to fight the US Department of Justice antitrust\\n25:03\\ndivision than all the lawyers the US Department of Justice antitrust division paid to fight all the cases in America\\n25:09\\n12 consecutive years and that paid off because by 19982 the president was\\n25:15\\nRonald Reagan a man whose official policy was that monopolies were efficient and he dropped the case and\\n25:21\\nbig blue wriggled off the hook it's hard to regulate a monopolist it's hard to\\n25:26\\nregulate a cartel when a sector is composed of hundreds of competing companies well they compete they\\n25:34\\ngenuinely fight with one another they are trying to poach each other's customers suppliers and uh key employees\\n25:39\\nthey are at each other's throats it's hard enough to get a couple hundred of exe hundred 100 Executives to agree on\\n25:46\\nanything but when they're legitimately competing with one another really obsessing about how to eat each other's\\n25:51\\nlunches they can't agree on anything the second one of them goes to a regulator with some [ __ ] story about how it's\\n25:59\\nimpossible to build a decent search engine without fine grain surveillance or impossible to have a secure and\\n26:04\\neasyto ous operating system without giving it a a a veto to the vendor about which apps you run or how it's\\n26:11\\nimpossible to administer an ISP unless you slow down connections to servers that haven't paid for premium Carriage\\n26:17\\nthere's going to be some other company saying no that's [ __ ] we managed it here's our logs here's our quarterly\\n26:23\\ncash books and here's our customer testimonials and they prove that these guys are lying\\n26:29\\n100 companies are rabble they are a mob they can't agree on a lobbying position they're too busy eating each other's\\n26:35\\nlunch to figure out how to cater a meeting where they would discuss a common lobbying position but let those\\n26:41\\n100 companies uh merge to Monopoly let them absorb one another in an incestuous\\n26:47\\norgy turn into five giant companies so inbred they get corporate hburg jaws and\\n26:53\\nthey will become a cartel and it's easy for a cartel to agree on what [ __ ]\\n26:58\\nthey're going to tell their regulators and to mobilize some of those excess billions that they've reaped through\\n27:04\\nconsolidation which freed them from wasteful competition so that they can capture their Regulators completely you\\n27:11\\nknow Congress used to pass consumer Federal privacy laws whenever we got a new technology not anymore the last time\\n27:18\\nCongress managed to sit down and pass a federal consumer Privacy Law in this country was\\n27:24\\n1988 the video privacy protection act it bans video store clerks from telling\\n27:29\\nnewspapers which VHS cassettes you took home in other words it regulates three things that no longer\\n27:35\\nexist the threat of having your video rental history out there in the public eye was not the last or the most\\n27:42\\nimportant privacy threat we have faced since 1988 and yet Congress has completely failed to pass a Privacy Law\\n27:50\\ntech companies uh regulatory capture involves a risible and transparent Gambit that is so stupid it's an insult\\n27:57\\nto all those risible transparent gambits working so hard out there in the world every day that Gambit is that they claim\\n28:03\\nthat when they violate your consumer your privacy or your labor rights that it's not a crime because they did it\\n28:09\\nwith an app algorithmic wage discrimination is not wage theft we did it with an app um spying on you from\\n28:16\\n[ __ ] to appetite not a privacy violation we did it with an app an Amazon scam that tricks people into\\n28:23\\npaying 29% more than the best match for their search they did it with an app\\n28:28\\nonce we killed competition once we stopped putting down rat poison we got cartels the rats came and ate our faces\\n28:35\\nand the cartels captured their Regulators the rats bought out the poison Factory and they shut it down so\\n28:41\\ncompanies are not constrained by competition or regulation but you know what this is Tech and Tech is different\\n28:49\\nit is different because it's flexible because our computers are these marvelous things called touring complete\\n28:55\\nUniversal Von nyman machines and that means that any intific alteration to a\\n29:01\\nprogram can be disin ified with another program every time HP jacks up the price\\n29:06\\nof ink they invite a competitor to make a refill kit or a compatible cartridge when Tesla installs code that only lets\\n29:14\\nyou use half the charge in your battery they invite a modder to start selling kits to jailbreak your Tesla so you can\\n29:20\\ncharge your whole battery let me take you through a little example of how this works imagine that instead of being here\\n29:26\\nat Defcon we're at a product design meeting for our company's website and the guy leading the meeting puts his hand up and he says all right folks here\\n29:33\\nit is our kpi is Topline ad Revenue I figured out if we make the ads 20% more\\n29:38\\ninvasive and obnoxious we're going to get 2% more ad Revenue we're all going to get a ski holiday in Switzerland this\\n29:44\\nyear and one guy sticks his hand up and he says I love how you think Elon but\\n29:52\\nhas but has it occurred to you that if we make the ads 20% more obnoxious then\\n29:58\\n40% of our users will go to a search engine and type how do I stop seeing ads I mean what a nightmare because once a\\n30:05\\nuser does that the revenue from that user doesn't rise to the projected 102%\\n30:10\\nit doesn't stay static at 100% it goes to zero it stays there forever and he\\n30:15\\nguesses why it never comes back no one ever went back to the search engine and typed how do I start seeing\\n30:21\\nads again once the user jailbreaks their phone or discovers third party or\\n30:28\\ndevelops a relationship with an independent Tesla mechanic who unlock all the DLC in their car that user is\\n30:34\\ngone forever interoperability that latent proper property bequeathed to us\\n30:40\\ncourtesy of haris touring and Von nyman and their infinitely flexible Universal machines is a is a very serious check on\\n30:48\\ninchid ification the fact that Congress hasn't passed a Privacy Law since 1988\\n30:54\\nin part you can counter that by uh uh with the Maj with the that the majority of web users are now running ad blockers\\n31:01\\nwhich are also privacy blockers but no one's ever installed a Tracker blocker for an app because reverse engineering\\n31:08\\nan app puts you in Jeopardy of criminal and civil prosecution under section 121\\n31:13\\nof the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with penalties of a 5-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a First\\n31:20\\nDefense and violating those terms of service puts you in Jeopardy under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act a 1986 law\\n31:28\\nthat Ronald Reagan was stampeded into passing after watching war games and freaking out\\n31:33\\nseriously helping others violate the terms of service by giving them a mod that makes you a Tor feaser engaged in\\n31:41\\ntorous interference with contract and then there's trademark copyright patent all the nonsense we call IP but which\\n31:48\\nJay Freeman from the city of project calls felony contempt of business model so we're back at that product planning\\n31:54\\nmeeting and now it's time to talk about our app and the guy leading the meeting he says all right we're going to make the ads in the app 20% more obnoxious\\n32:01\\nand everyone turns to the loudmouth who shot it down last time and he says no no that's fine but look why are we stopping\\n32:07\\nat 20% why don't we make the ads 100% more obnoxious and get 10% more Revenue\\n32:13\\nbecause we don't care if the user goes and types how do I stop seeing ads into a search engine because you can't so\\n32:19\\nYOLO just in [ __ ] ay way IP is a euphemism for any law that lets an\\n32:25\\nexecutive reach outside of the walls of their business and exert control over customers critics and competitors and an\\n32:31\\napp is just a web page skinned with the right kind of Ip to make it a felony to put an ad blocker in\\n32:39\\nit thank you interrupt used to stop companies\\n32:45\\nfrom in\\n32:50\\nshtifanov out a feature and wanted to sell it back to us as a monthly subscription someone would make a\\n32:55\\ncompatible plugin that worked for a onetime fee or you know for free to help people flee Myspace Facebook gave them a\\n33:02\\nbot you gave that bot your login and password for Myspace it would log in as you several times a day scrape your\\n33:08\\nwaiting messages put them in your Facebook inbox and autopilot them back out onto Facebook so you didn't have to\\n33:14\\nchoose between the people you loved who are on MySpace and Facebook which had promised that it would never spy on you\\n33:20\\ndo you remember that now thanks to the metastasis of Ip all of that is off the\\n33:25\\ntable today Apple owes it very existence to the eyework suite Pages numbers\\n33:30\\nkeynote which are file compatible with Microsoft Office Word uh Excel and\\n33:36\\nPowerPoint but make an iOS runtime that plays back the files you bought from Apple stores on other platforms and they\\n33:42\\nwill nuke you till you glow Facebook wouldn't have had a hope of breaking myspace's grip on social\\n33:49\\nmedia without that scraper but scrape Facebook today in support of an alternative client and their lawyers\\n33:54\\nwill bomb you until the rubble bounces Google scrap every website in the world to create a search index try and scrape\\n34:01\\nGoogle and your head will be on a pike when they did it that was progress when you do it that is piracy every pirate\\n34:08\\nwants to be an admiral and because this handful of companies has so thoroughly captured their regulator they can wield\\n34:15\\nthe power of the State against you when you try to break their grip on power even as their own flagrant violations of\\n34:22\\nour rights go unpunished because they do them with an app Tech lost it fear of\\n34:28\\ncompetition it neutralized the threat from its regulators and then it put those Regulators in harness to attack\\n34:34\\nnew startups who might do onto them as they did unto everyone who dominated before them but even then there was one\\n34:41\\nforce that still kept our bosses in check and that was us that was Tech workers Tech workers have historically\\n34:49\\nbeen in very short supply and that gave us power and our bosses knew it they to\\n34:54\\nget us to work crazy hours they came up with a trick they appealed to our love of Technology they told us we were\\n35:01\\nHeroes of the digital transformation that we would organize the world's information and make it useful what we\\n35:07\\nwould bring the world closer together they brought in expert set dressers to\\n35:13\\nturn our workplaces into Whimsical campuses with free laundry Gourmet cafeterias massages kombucha and a\\n35:20\\nsurgeon onand who would freeze your eggs so you could work through your fertile years they convinced us that we were\\n35:27\\nbeing pampered rather than being tricked into working like government mules now that trick it has a name fiar the\\n35:34\\nlibrarian she calls it vocational awe but Elon Musk just calls it being\\n35:39\\nextremely hardcore and it and it worked well we did put in some long ass hours\\n35:46\\nbut for our bosses this trick failed badly because if you miss your mother's funeral in order to hit some deadline\\n35:53\\nand then your boss orders you to entify the product you missed the funeral for you are going to experience a profound\\n35:59\\nmoral injury which you are absolutely going to make your boss very aware of\\n36:05\\nbecause what are they going to do fire you they can't hire someone else to do your job and the guy across the street\\n36:10\\nwill pay you just as much so workers we held the line when competition\\n36:16\\nregulation and interoperability failed but Supply caught up with demand last\\n36:21\\nyear they fired 260,000 Tech sector workers first six months of this year was another 100,000 you can't tell your\\n36:28\\nbosses to go [ __ ] themselves because they'll fire your ass and give your job to someone else who will be happy to\\n36:33\\nentify the product you sweated blood to ship that's why all this is happening\\n36:39\\nright now our bosses are not different they did not catch a mind virus that\\n36:44\\nturn them into greedy [ __ ] who don't care about our users's well-being or the quality of our products as far as our\\n36:50\\nbosses are concerned they have uh the point of that business was to charge the most deliver the least and share as\\n36:57\\nlittle as possible with suppliers workers and customers in order to retain money for shareholders and Executives\\n37:04\\nthey are not running Charities since day one our bosses have reported for work every morning grabbed the giant lever\\n37:11\\nbehind their desk labeled in [ __ ] ification and pulled on it as hard as they could but the lever didn't move\\n37:17\\nmuch it was gummed up by competition by regulation by interoperability by the tech Workforce and as those sources of\\n37:24\\nfriction melted away that inchid ification lever started moving pretty freely now that sucks I know but think\\n37:30\\nabout this for a sec our bosses despite being wildly imperfect vessels capable\\n37:36\\nof rationalizing endless greed and cheating nevertheless made a series of actually great products and services not\\n37:44\\nbecause they were better people then but because they were subject to discipline so it follows that if we want to end the\\n37:50\\ninene if we want to dismantle the in shitet if we want to build a new good internet that our bosses can't wreck we\\n37:58\\nneed to make sure that those constraints are durably installed on our new internet wound around its roots and\\n38:03\\nnerves and we have to stand guard over those forces so that they can't be dismantled again a new good internet is\\n38:11\\none that has the positive aspects of the old good internet the ethic of technological self-determination where\\n38:17\\nusers of technology and the hackers the tinkerers the startups and the others who serve as their proxies can\\n38:23\\nreconfigure the technology to make it work so that it does what they needed to do and cannot be used against them but\\n38:29\\nthe new good internet has to fix the defect of the old good internet the part that made it hard for anyone who wasn't\\n38:35\\nus to figure out how to use it and hell yeah we can do that Tech bosses swear that this is impossible you can't have a\\n38:42\\nconversation with a friend without Zuck being present you can't search the web without letting Google scrape you down\\n38:47\\nto your viscera you can't have a phone that works reliable uh reliably without Apple getting a veto over your software\\n38:54\\nthey claim that it's nonsense to even Ponder this proposition it's like making water that's not wet but that is\\n39:00\\n[ __ ] we can have nice things we can build for the people we love and give\\n39:05\\nthem a place worthy of their time and attention to do that we have to install constraints the first constraint\\n39:12\\nremember it's competition we are living through an epocal shift in competition policy after 40 Years of antitrust\\n39:20\\nenforcement in an induced coma a wave of antitrust Vigor has swept through governments all over the world\\n39:26\\nregulators stepping up to ban monopolistic practices to open up wild Gardens to block anti-competitive\\n39:32\\nmergers and even unwind the corrupt mergers that were undertaken on false pretenses now normally this is the part\\n39:39\\nin this speech where I'd listed all the amazing things that have happened over the past four years the enforcement\\n39:45\\nactions that block companies from becoming too big to care and that scared companies away from even trying like\\n39:50\\nwhiz which just kned out of the largest acquisition offer in world history\\n39:56\\nturning down Google's $23 billion buyout and deciding to you know just be a [ __ ] business that makes money by\\n40:03\\nmaking a product that people want that is sold at a competitive price normally I'd be listing out FTC rule makings here\\n40:10\\nor the ban n that ban Nong competes worldwide uh or the new merger guidelines that the FTC and the doj\\n40:16\\ncooked up which among other things make privacy something that has to be considered in mergers I had a whole\\n40:22\\nsection of this stuff in my notes an absolute Victory lap but I deleted it this week does anyone anyone know why I\\n40:27\\ndeleted it this week anyone want to guess all right this week judge Amit\\n40:34\\nmeta ruling for the DC Circuit of these United States of America in the docket\\n40:39\\n20-30 one0 in a case known as United States versus Google LLC found that\\n40:46\\nGoogle is a monopolist and it has acted as a monopolist to maintain its Monopoly\\n40:52\\nand ordered that Google and the doj propose a schedule for a remedy like break the company\\n41:03\\nup so yeah that was pretty [ __ ] epic now this antitrust stuff is esoteric and\\n41:08\\nI'm not going to shame you if you want to keep a little distance on the subject nearly everyone is an antitrust Normie\\n41:13\\nand that's fine but if you're a normie you're probably only catching little bits and pieces of this narrative and\\n41:19\\nlet me tell you the monopolists know that and they are flooding The Zone with [ __ ] the Wall Street Journal has published 100 editorials condemning con\\n41:27\\nthe chair of the Federal Trade Commission for doing nothing and getting nothing done with public funds anyone\\n41:32\\nout there who know who owns The Wall Street Journal no rert Murdoch rert Murdoch do\\n41:40\\nyou really think Rupert Murdoch Pays His editorial board to write 100 op EDS about someone who's not getting anything\\n41:46\\ndone the reality is that in the United States in the UK in the EU in Australia\\n41:52\\nand Canada and China in Japan and South Korea we are seeing more antitrust action over the past 4 years than over\\n41:58\\nthe preceding 40 and remember the competition law is pretty robust the problem is not the law it's the\\n42:04\\nenforcement priorities Reagan put them in mothballs 40 years ago but that is an elegant weapon from a more civilized age\\n42:11\\nand it has found its way into the hands of people who sure know how to use it and they are swinging for the fences so\\n42:18\\nnext up is regulation as the seemingly inescapable power of the tech Giants is revealed as the Sham that we always\\n42:24\\nsuspected it was governments and Regulators are finally going to kill the one weird trick of violating the law but\\n42:29\\nsaying it's okay cuz we did it with an app in the EU they've got the new digital markets app that requires\\n42:35\\ndominant platforms to open up API so that you can move easily between services and that's a very cool rule but\\n42:41\\nwhat's even cooler is how it's going to be enforced previous EU rules they were called regulations which meant that they\\n42:47\\nhad to be turned into law in each EU member State um and for big Tech that meant that all uh enforcement of laws\\n42:54\\nlike the general data privacy protection regulation started in Ireland where they all pretend to be headquartered and they\\n43:00\\npretend to be headquartered in Ireland because Ireland is a tax Haven and so they fly Irish flags of convenience but\\n43:06\\nhere's the thing if every tax Haven has to be a crime Haven because any company\\n43:11\\nthat is foot loose enough to pretend to be Irish this week could pretend to be maltes or or uh luxembourgian or uh\\n43:18\\ncypret next week so to keep those Foot Loose criminal Enterprises happy that they they have to stop enforcing their\\n43:25\\nlaws that's why the gdpr is such a godamn joke in practice because the only way to get these companies held to\\n43:32\\naccount for their gdpr policies is to go after them in Ireland where the Irish data commissioner barely gets out of bed\\n43:38\\nand when they do they usually spend most of the the day in their pajamas eating breakfast cereal in front of the\\n43:44\\ntelevision now all of this is hardly a secret the European commission knows that it's going on so with the dma the\\n43:50\\ncommission starts all of the reg all of the enforcement in the federal courts which have no uh way in which they are\\n43:57\\nbeholden to these big uh tech companies in other words the we vote priv we\\n44:02\\nviolate privacy excuse me we violate Privacy Law uh that work but it's okay\\n44:08\\nbecause we did it with an app that worked for so many years it's now a dead letter and here in the US the uh dam is\\n44:14\\nfinally breaking on getting a federal Privacy Law for us it's been a minute and the thing is there are a lot of\\n44:20\\npeople who are very angry about how poor Privacy Law is in America not because they're worried about privacy but\\n44:26\\nbecause they worried about other stuff maybe Grampy uh was on Facebook and you think that's how he became a q andon or\\n44:32\\nyou think maybe insta made your teen anorexic or you're worried that cops rolled up all the demonstrators at that\\n44:37\\nblack lives matter demonstration using Google location data or you're worried that they did it to the January 6 riers\\n44:43\\nor that you're worried that red State Attorneys General follow teenagers across state lines into abortion clinics\\n44:49\\nor you're worried that black people are being discriminated against in lending and job applications or that someone made AI uh deep fake porn of you a\\n44:57\\nFederal Privacy Law with a private right of action would do something about all of those problems that makes a very big\\n45:02\\nCoalition for Privacy Law which is why we're seeing a procession of imperfect but steadily improving privacy laws\\n45:09\\nworking their way through Congress so I work for the electronic froner Foundation if you sign up for our list\\n45:15\\nat eff.org we're going to send you emails when those laws come up and you can call up your Congress jerk or your\\n45:21\\nSenator and you can talk to them about it you can make an appointment to drop by their offices when they're in their home district and expl to them that\\n45:27\\nyou're not just a registered voter from their districts that you're the kind of tech person who goes to Defcon and then\\n45:32\\nyou can explain the bill to them that stuff makes a difference so how about self-help how are we doing on making\\n45:39\\ninteroperability legal again I'm I'm nearly done two minutes sorry my mic\\n45:45\\nstopped working for a minute uh how how are we doing on making I'm\\n45:52\\nseriously almost done stop clapping so I can finish uh how are we doing on making interoperability Al again when we got\\n45:57\\nthese state right right to repair bills that ban Parts pairing that ban using DRM for parts uh these bills are pushed\\n46:05\\nby a fantastic group of organizations called the repair Coalition at rep.org and they'll email you one one of these\\n46:12\\nbills are going through your state house and you can meet with your state reps and explain to the JV Squad what you just explained to your federal reps and\\n46:18\\nthe prime mover behind rep.org is I fix it and I fix its founder Kyle wans is here at Defcon so when you see him shake\\n46:26\\nhis hand thank for a service but tell him you've signed up for the mailing list as well now on to that last uh\\n46:32\\nWorkforce and my last page I promise uh uh the the thing that used to stop Tech\\n46:37\\nbosses from going bad and that's you the tech Workforce for years your bosses tricked you into thinking you are\\n46:42\\nfounders and waiting temporarily embarrassed entrepreneurs momentarily drawing a salary not workers your power\\n46:49\\ncame from intrinsic virtue not those La not like those lazy slobs in their unions now that was a trick and you got\\n46:55\\nscammed the power you had came from scarcity so when scarcity ended your indust the industry when the industry\\n47:01\\nstarted ringing in six-figure layoffs your power went away the only durable source of power for Tech workers is as\\n47:08\\nworkers in unions think about Amazon think hold I got to finish stop\\n47:15\\nclapping uh think about Amazon warehouse workers have to piss in bottles and have the highest rate of on the job industry\\n47:22\\nuh injuries of any uh comparable company in the industry whereas Amazon coders get to show up for work with facial\\n47:28\\npiercings green Mohawks and black t-shirts that say things their bosses don't understand they can piss whenever\\n47:34\\nthey want to that's not because Jeff Bezos loves Tech workers it's because they're scared you'll quit and they\\n47:40\\nwon't be able to replace you another willing Gibson quote the future is here it's just not evenly distributed you\\n47:45\\nknow who lives in the future Amazon warehouse workers they are living in your future drivers whose eyeballs are\\n47:52\\nmonitored by AI cameras that do phenology on their faces to figure out when went to dock their pay and\\n47:58\\nwarehouse workers whose bodies are ruined in a matter of months as Tech bosses beef up this Reserve Army of un\\n48:05\\nunemployed skilled Tech workers those Tech workers you folks will arrive at the same future as them look I know you\\n48:12\\nspent your careers explaining in words so small your boss could understand them that you refuse to entify your company's\\n48:17\\nproducts and I thank you for your service but if you want to go on fighting for the user you need power\\n48:23\\nthat's better than scarcity you need a union want to learn how check out the tech workers Coalition and Tech\\n48:29\\nsolidarity and get organized and [ __ ] ification is not here because our bosses changed they were always that guy they\\n48:35\\nwere always yanking the lever what changed was the environment everything that kept the inch ification switch from\\n48:41\\nmoving and that is good news because it means that we can have good products with imperfect people a new good\\n48:47\\ninternet is in our grasp an internet with the technological self-determination of the old good\\n48:52\\ninternet and the grease skid Simplicity of Web 2.0 that let Normie friends get in on the fun Tech bosses want you to\\n48:58\\nthink that ux and in shid ification can't be separated and that is self-serving [ __ ] we know it because\\n49:05\\nwe built the old good internet and we've been fighting a rear guard action to preserve it over the past two decades\\n49:10\\nand it's time to stop playing defense and go on the offense to restore competition to restore regulation\\n49:16\\ninteroperability and Tech worker power so that we can create a new good internet that we're going to need to\\n49:21\\nfight fascism the climate emergency and genocide to build a digital nervous system for for the 21st century in which\\n49:28\\nour children will Thrive and prosper

Given the interdisciplinary nature of the user\\'s background, I should cover:\\n\\n1. The basic psychological concept\\n2. Mathematical formalization where possible\\n3.

Each agent $i \\\\in V$ maintains:\\n\\n- **Private belief state**: $b_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}$ representing genuine attitudes\\n- **Perceived social norm**: $n_i^{(t)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}$ representing estimated group consensus at time $t$\\n- **Public expression**: $p_i^{(t)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}$ representing stated positions\\n\\nThe **social comparison function** for agent $i$ is:\\n\\n$$SC_i^{(t)} = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in N_i} w_{ij} \\\\cdot \\\\sigma(p_j^{(t-1)} - \\\\tau_i)$$\\n\\nwhere $N_i$ represents $i$\\'s network neighborhood, $\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot)$ is a sigmoid activation, and $\\\\tau_i$ is agent $i$\\'s [[social proof threshold]].\\n\\n### Manufactured Consensus Dynamics\\n\\nDefine the **authenticity ratio** of observed signals:\\n\\n$$\\\\alpha^{(t)} = \\\\frac{|\\\\{i : p_i^{(t)} = h(b_i, SC_i^{(t)})\\\\}|}{|\\\\{i : p_i^{(t)} \\\\text{ observed}\\\\}|}$$\\n\\nwhere $h(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)$ represents genuine belief expression as a function of private beliefs and social context.\\n\\nUnder [[coordinated inauthentic behavior]], malicious actors inject synthetic signals $\\\\{p_{bot}^{(t)}\\\\}$ such that:\\n\\n$$\\\\alpha^{(t)} = \\\\frac{|V_{authentic}|}{|V_{authentic}| + |V_{synthetic}|} < \\\\alpha_{critical}$$\\n\\nWhen $\\\\alpha^{(t)}$ falls below the critical threshold, the [[preference falsification cascade]] begins.\\n\\n## Mathematical Formalization of Norm Adoption\\n\\n### Misanthropic Norm Diffusion\\n\\nLet $m: \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\rightarrow [0,1]$ represent the **misanthropy index** of expressed positions, where higher values indicate greater dehumanization, [[out-group hostility]], or [[zero-sum thinking]]. The adoption dynamic follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{dm_i^{(t)}}{dt} = \\\\lambda_i \\\\left[ \\\\bar{m}_{N_i}^{(t)} - m_i^{(t)} \\\\right] + \\\\eta_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{I}[\\\\text{perceived majority}] - \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta_{moral}^{(t)}$$\\n\\nwhere:\\n- $\\\\lambda_i$ is the conformity coefficient\\n- $\\\\bar{m}_{N_i}^{(t)}$ is the perceived neighborhood misanthropy level\\n- $\\\\eta_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbb{I}[\\\\text{perceived majority}]$ represents [[bandwagon effects]]\\n- $\\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta_{moral}^{(t)}$ represents moral resistance\\n\\n### Information Operation Optimization\\n\\nAuthoritarian actors solve the optimization problem:\\n\\n$$\\\\max_{\\\\{p_{synthetic}\\\\}} \\\\sum_{i \\\\in V_{target}} m_i^{(T)} \\\\text{ subject to } \\\\alpha^{(t)} \\\\geq \\\\alpha_{detection}$$\\n\\nThis maximizes misanthropic norm adoption while maintaining plausible deniability.\\n\\n## Exploitation Mechanisms\\n\\n### Astroturfing-Amplified Social Proof\\n\\n[[Astroturfing]] operations create synthetic [[social proof]] by deploying coordinated bot networks that exhibit temporal clustering:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{bot posts at } t | \\\\text{trigger event}) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\pi_k \\\\mathcal{N}(t; \\\\mu_k, \\\\sigma_k^2)$$\\n\\nThis generates artificial [[trending phenomena]] that human users interpret as genuine grassroots sentiment.\\n\\n### Echo Chamber Amplification\\n\\nWithin [[echo chambers]], the perceived consensus becomes:\\n\\n$$C_{perceived}^{(k)} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\text{chamber}_k} w_{kj} \\\\cdot p_j}{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\text{chamber}_k} w_{kj}}$$\\n\\nMalicious actors exploit chamber homophily by targeting high-influence nodes with [[confirmation bias]]-aligned content.\\n\\n### Psychological Reactance Exploitation\\n\\nThe model incorporates [[psychological reactance]] by defining a **freedom threat function**:\\n\\n$$\\\\Psi_i^{(t)} = \\\\max\\\\{0, \\\\beta \\\\cdot (\\\\text{perceived pressure})^2 - \\\\text{autonomy threshold}_i\\\\}$$\\n\\nSophisticated operations alternate between pressure and apparent choice to minimize reactance while maximizing compliance.\\n\\n## Temporal Dynamics and Phase Transitions\\n\\n### Critical Mass Phenomena\\n\\nThe system exhibits phase transitions at critical adoption thresholds. Define the **misanthropic saturation** as:\\n\\n$$S^{(t)} = \\\\frac{1}{|V|} \\\\sum_{i \\\\in V} \\\\mathbb{I}[m_i^{(t)} > m_{threshold}]$$\\n\\nThe transition occurs when:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{dS}{dt} \\\\bigg|_{S=S_c} = \\\\infty$$\\n\\nindicating a [[social tipping point]] where norm adoption becomes self-sustaining.\\n\\n### Hysteresis Effects\\n\\nOnce established, misanthropic norms exhibit [[hysteresis]], requiring significantly more effort to reverse than to establish:\\n\\n$$m_{reversal\\\\_threshold} \\\\ll m_{adoption\\\\_threshold}$$\\n\\nThis asymmetry enables [[ratchet effects]] in authoritarian norm diffusion.\\n\\n## Algorithmic Amplification\\n\\n### Engagement-Driven Optimization\\n\\nSocial media algorithms optimizing for engagement inadvertently amplify divisive content. Let $E(p)$ represent the engagement score for post $p$. The algorithmic ranking function:\\n\\n$$R(p_i) = \\\\alpha_1 \\\\log(E(p_i)) + \\\\alpha_2 \\\\cdot \\\\text{recency}(p_i) + \\\\alpha_3 \\\\cdot \\\\text{relevance}(p_i, u)$$\\n\\nsystematically privileges high-arousal content, including [[outrage-inducing]] misanthropic messages.\\n\\n### Filter Bubble Reinforcement\\n\\n[[Collaborative filtering]] algorithms create [[filter bubbles]] by optimizing similarity metrics:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{sim}(u_i, u_j) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}_j}{||\\\\mathbf{p}_i|| \\\\cdot ||\\\\mathbf{p}_j||}$$\\n\\nThis concentrates like-minded users and amplifies minority viewpoints within local clusters.\\n\\n## Cognitive Vulnerability Exploitation\\n\\n### Availability Heuristic Manipulation\\n\\nCoordinated content injection exploits the [[availability heuristic]] by ensuring misanthropic examples dominate easily recalled instances:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{recall misanthropic example}) = 1 - e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\text{exposure frequency}}$$\\n\\n### System Justification Subversion\\n\\nThe framework exploits [[system justification theory]] by presenting authoritarian alternatives as stability-restoring:\\n\\n$$J_{system}^{(t)} = f(\\\\text{perceived chaos}, \\\\text{authoritarian solution salience})$$\\n\\nWhen perceived chaos exceeds tolerance thresholds, individuals become receptive to authoritarian \"solutions.\"\\n\\n## Defense Mechanisms\\n\\n### Distributed Consensus Verification\\n\\nImplement [[Byzantine-fault-tolerant]] consensus protocols that require:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{agreement} \\\\Leftarrow |\\\\{i : \\\\text{verify}(claim_i) = \\\\text{true}\\\\}| \\\\geq \\\\frac{2n}{3} + 1$$\\n\\nThis prevents synthetic majorities from establishing false consensus.\\n\\n### Cognitive Inoculation Protocols\\n\\nDeploy [[prebunking]] strategies using [[cognitive inoculation]] theory:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{resistance}^{(t+1)} = \\\\text{resistance}^{(t)} + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\text{weakened\\\\_exposure} - \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\text{decay}$$\\n\\n### Transparency-Preserving Detection\\n\\nUtilize [[differential privacy]] methods to detect coordination while preserving user privacy:\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{f}(D) = f(D) + \\\\text{Lap}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\right)$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\Delta f$ is the sensitivity of coordination detection function $f$.\\n\\n## Countermeasures and Resilience\\n\\n### Network Structural Interventions\\n\\nImplement [[random graph rewiring]] to break [[homophily-driven]] clustering:\\n\\n$$P(\\\\text{rewire edge } (i,j)) = \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\text{similarity}(i,j)^{-1}$$\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity Metrics\\n\\nMonitor network-level epistemic health via:\\n\\n$$H_{epistemic} = -\\\\sum_{belief} P(belief) \\\\log P(belief) + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\text{cross-cutting ties}$$\\n\\n## Related Concepts\\n\\n- [[Social Comparison Theory]]\\n- [[Information Cascades]]\\n- [[Astroturfing]]\\n- [[Echo Chambers]]\\n- [[Preference Falsification]]\\n- [[Psychological Reactance]]\\n- [[System Justification Theory]]\\n- [[Cognitive Inoculation]]\\n- [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance]]\\n- [[Filter Bubbles]]\\n- [[Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior]]',\n",
